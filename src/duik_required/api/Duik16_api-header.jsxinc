/**
 * To use the Duik API, just include the API file in the beginning of your script.<br />
 * Most of the methods work without any parameter but use the context (the active composition, the selected layers and properties).<br />
 * If you need lower-level methods, for example being able to set an IK on specific layers or to wiggle specific properties,<br />
 * you should use the {@link http://duaef-docs.rainboxlab.org/ | DuAEF Framework} - Duduf After Effects Framework, which Duik is based on.<br />
 * A {@link http://duaef-reference.rainboxlab.org/ | complete reference of this framework is available here}.<br />
 * The API is contained in the <code>Duik</code> object, and DuAEF is also made available in the <code>DuAEF</code> object.<br />
 * @example
 * //encapsulate everything to avoid global variables !important!
 * (function(thisObj) {
 *     //include the API
 *     #include 'Duik16_api.jsxinc'
 *     //Now the Duik API is available in the Duik object, and DuAEF is also available.
 *
 *     //We need to initialize DuAEF before using it. You must provide a script name and version.
 *     DuAEF.init("Your Awesome Script Name", "1.0.2");
 *
 *     //Now you can create your UI if any, and initialize what you need.
 *     //DuAEF can be of great help, it has a lot of methods for creating the UI, handle After Effects, and more.
 *     //Read the reference at duaef-reference.rainboxlab.org
 *
 *     //When everything is ready and before using the Duik API,
 *     //We need to tell DuAEF we're entering run state so it can finish to prepare its stuff.
 *     DuAEF.enterRunTime();
 *     
 *     // Create a hominoid structure
 *     // The whole API is contained in the Duik object
 *     Duik.structures.mammal();
 *     // Select all Structures
 *     Duik.structures.select();
 *     // Run the Autorig
 *     Duik.constraints.autorig();
 *     // Select all controllers
 *     Duik.controllers.select();
 *     // Make the character walk!
 *     Duik.automation.walk();
 *     //Have Fun!
 *  })(this);
