## Toggle Edit Mode

In the edition panel, you can adjust the appearance of the Structures (Normal and Expert mode).

All changes made in this panel will affect all selected Structures and the creation of all other Structures.

- You can change the size of the Structures, either automatically, relatively to the size of the composition (small, medium and large options), or with an absolute value (custom option).

- You can change the color of the Structures: if you click on the colored label, a color picker will be shown, but you can also set your own hexadecimal color code in the text field. A random button will set a random color.
NOTE: The color parameter is ignored when you create predefined limbs (arm, leg, etc.), but you can always change the color afterwards.

- You can pick the selected Structure appearance with the "Get" button, and set the parameters to the selection with the "Set" button.

- The "Bake Appearance" button will remove all expressions used by the Structure to set its appearance. This will improve the performance of the rig, but you will not be able to change the appearance afterwards.
NOTE: by default, the Auto-Rig automatically bakes the appearance of the Structures.
