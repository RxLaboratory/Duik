2. Click on the "Blink" button

The Blink can be adjusted in the effects of the corresponding layer.

## Effect

![Blink effects example](img\duik-screenshots\S-Rigging\S-Rigging-Automations\Blink-effects-example.png)

By default, with the "A/B Ratio" set to 50%, each state is set exactly the same time, changing this ratio can make the property stay longer on one or the other of the states.
