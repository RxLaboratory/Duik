# Supported versions of After Effects 

Duik has been tested and is working with all versions of After Effects since CS6. That means it works correctly on:
CS6 (11), CC (12), CC2014 (13), CC2015 (13.5), CC2017 (14), CC2018 (15), CC2019 (16).

!!! note
    CS6 has a lot of issues with the Script Panels like the ones used by Duik. Duik will work on CS6, but you may have to close and re-open it often to fix the issues you may have with the UI…

!!! warning
    All versions before CS6 can not run Duik, sorry! It’s time to update…

# Installation

**1 - Download** Duik from the [official website](https://rainboxprod.coop/en/tools/duik/).


**2 - Unzip** the files you have downloaded.


**3 -** There are several ways to install Duik very easily:  

a. Copy all the files to:

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\`  
- Mac OS: `/Applications/Adobe After Effects CC/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels`  
You may need administrator privileges to install Duik this way. If you don't have them, see the other ways below.

!!! Warning
    With the other installation methods, some features using third party tools, like transcoding sound when exporting to Adobe Audition, may not work correctly.

b. This method works only on the most recent versions of After Effects (since CC2018):  

- Open After Effects  
- *Windows*: Holding the [Alt] and [Shift] keys, drag and drop the file `Duik Bassel.jsx` onto the project panel.  
- *Mac OS*: Holding the [Options] and [Shift] keys, drag and drop the file `Duik Bassel.jsx` onto the project panel.  

c. This method works only on the latest versions of After Effects (since CC2019):  

- Open After Effects  
- Use the `File/Scritps/Install ScriptUI Panel...` menu to select and install `Duik Bassel.jsx`.  

**4 - Restart** After Effects and Duik will be available in the "Window" menu.

# Without installation 

You'll always be able to run Duik without even installing it. This is a good way to use it if you do not have administrator privileges on an older version of After Effects.

- Unzip all the files in any folder.  
- Launch After Effects, and start Duik via the `File/Scripts/Run script file...` menu.
