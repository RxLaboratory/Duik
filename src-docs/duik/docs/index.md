> _You’re reading the user guide of the newest version of Duik, the 16th, which involved months of development, 10 years after the release of the first version of Duik._

> _This new version of Duik is the biggest script I have ever developped for After Effects, and I believe it is actually the biggest script available for After Effects._

> _It’s not just a new version of the Duik you may already know, it is a whole new thing, each and every line of code has been re-read, re-thought and re-written, with a lot of additions, improvements and new features._

> _I’ve come to realize that Duik is not just a script anymore, but it really deserves its name of "tool set" for After Effects. The complete list of features is huge, and it’s more like a lot of different scripts packaged together to bring animation in After Effects to a whole new level._

> _I’ve been working very hard on it, and I’m very proud to give it to you. For free! Yes, it’s still free, even if a lot of its individual features could be scripts sold for dozens of dollars, because we still believe free and open source software can make the world better, and we stick to our convictions. Of course, this could not be possible without your invaluable support._
