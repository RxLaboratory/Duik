## Using *DuAEF* to develop your own scripts

*DuAEF* includes some [libraries for developpers](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF_Duik/tree/master/src) with classes, methods and tools to ease the scripting process in After Effects, as long as adding features (like pngquant, ffmpeg, or json, and new ScriptUI Controls) not available in After Effects/ExtendScript.

It is very easy to use and [documented](../How-to).
