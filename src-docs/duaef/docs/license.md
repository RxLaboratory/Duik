# User Licence

The Duduf After Effects Framework is free software released under the [GNU-General Public License v3](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF_Duik/blob/master/LICENSE). This license guarantees you four freedoms:

- The freedom to **run the program as you wish**, for any purpose,  
- The freedom to **study how the program works, and change it**, so it does your computing as you wish,  
- The freedom to **redistribute copies** so you can help your fellow animator  
- The freedom to distribute **copies of your modified versions** to others.

## What it means for users

The first freedom guarantees that **you can use the software as you wish**, for any work, either it’s commercial, or personnal, or non-profit. Works made with the help of our tools are yours and you can do what you want with them.

You don’t need any authorization or contract. Download, install, have fun!

Just know that **we’re very curious to see what you’ve made with our tools**, so [you can send us the result of your work](https://rainboxprod.coop/en/#contact)! You can help the developement of the free tools too, with a [donation](donation.md).

## What it means for developpers

The second freedom **lets you change the software as you need**. You can get the source code on [Github](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF_Duik/).

The third and fourth freedoms let you **share our tools and distribute them** yourself, with ou without your changes. However, in order to keep those four freedoms, the GNU General Public License restricts the **release of the tools (including your changes) under a compatible license, one which guarantees these four freedoms too**. Thus, **you can neither sell the tools, nor keep the source code private**. You must list all the authors of the free software you share and change too. In short, the tools, with or without changes, must stay free.

If you include any part of the source code of our tools – even a short part – in your own tools, they must be released under a free software license too. **You cannot sell any software including some code licensed under a free license**.
