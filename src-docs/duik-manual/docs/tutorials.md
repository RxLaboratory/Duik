## Official Tutorials

### Using Duik and Character rigging

!!! note
    We're currently in the making of the Official Duik Bassel video course, a very complete course with a lot of tutorials like [the one we made for the previous version](https://en.tuto.com/after-effects/after-effects-and-duik-setup-your-first-characters-after-effects,73651.html?cc=vyKT3i), Duik 15.

    All tutorials about how the tools of Duik work will be free, and the complete course with exercises and practical examples will be available at a low and fair price.

!!! hint
    If you already paid for the Duik 15 video course, don't worry, we'll be offering nice discount for the new Duik Bassel course as soon as it's available. This coupon will be sent in an e-mail from [tuto.com](https://en.tuto.com?cc=vyKT3i), just make sure those are not in your spam folder ;)
