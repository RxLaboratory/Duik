**The comprehensive rigging and animation toolkit for Adobe After Effects.**

## Introduction

Duik’s **comprehensiveness**, **ease of use**, and **15 years of continuous innovation** have made it the leading tool and the industry standard for **rigging and animation** with After Effects.

**It provides all the rigging tools** you need to control and animate complex characters, props, cameras…

Duik has plenty of animation tools too to help managing keyframes and interpolations, tweening and traditional animation.

**Automations**, like wiggle, random motion, wheel, spring, bounce, looper, swing, blink, walk & run cycle… can help you animate more quickly and easily.

Duik also includes lots of useful tools, such as **camera controls** or **scripting and expression** tools, that are not solely tied to animation but can be really useful for riggers, animators, motion designers and compositors.
