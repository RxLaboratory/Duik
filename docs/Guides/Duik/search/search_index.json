This new version of Duik is the biggest script I have ever developped for After Effects, and I believe it is actually the biggest script available for After Effects. It\u2019s not just a new version of the Duik you may already know, it is a whole new thing, each and every line of code has been re-read, re-thought and re-written, with a lot of additions, improvements and new features. I\u2019ve come to realize that Duik is not just a script anymore, but it really deserves its name of \u201ctool set\u201d for After Effects. The complete list of features is huge, and it\u2019s more like a lot of different scripts packaged together to bring animation in After Effects to a whole new level. I\u2019ve been working very hard on it, and I\u2019m very proud to give it to you. For free! Yes, it\u2019s still free, even if a lot of its individual features could be scripts sold for dozens of dollars, because we still believe free and open source software can make the world better, and we stick to our convictions. Of course, this could not be possible without your invaluable support. - Duduf","title":"Home"},{"location":"animation-blender-setup.html","text":"Animation Blender The Animation blender is a tool to animate using markers to trigger animations. In a composition, you can have several animations, one after each other. The animation blender is a simple controller (a layer) where you add markers which will trigger these animations. The animation blender is able to blend the animations together during transitions right after a marker, and it\u2019s also able to loop the animations after they have been triggered, if you need. Hint Once the animation blender have been set up, a simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set the markers to trigger animations. There are two things which need to be set up: the animations (the animated properties), and the Blender controller itself. The first part of the panel allows to quickly set the animations, while the second part is used to set the Blender up. Animations setup As soon as you have animated what you want to trigger, you have to set some markers in the composition to define when these animations begin and end. Each marker must have a name (which can be whatever you want), and a duration which is exactly the duration of your animation. Warning With versions of After Effects more recent than 14.0 (CC2017), these markers can be set on the composition itself, but with older versions, they have to be set on a layer named exactly \u201cDuik | Animation blender\u201d. To help you to set these markers, you can set their name in Duik, and then click the \u201cSet\u201d button. This will create a marker where it should be, using the work area of the composition to set its time and duration in a single click. Blender Setup Setting the composition up for the Blender is easy: Select the composition containing the animations you want to set up in the menu. You can use the eyedropper to quickly get the active composition. Select the composition from where you want to animate using the Animation Blender. It can be the same composition as the rigged one if you wish. You can choose to rig all animated properties, or only the selected ones. Setting only the selected properties up allows to have several controllers for the same composition, thus allowing to rig very complicating things\u2026 Click on the \u201cBlend!\u201d button to set everything up. Use To use the blender, you just have to add markers with the name of the animation on the controller layer. Each marker will trigger the corresponding animation. Caution Their name have to be exactly the same, and it is case sensitive. A simple tool in the Animation panel (Tools tab) of Duik can be used to easily set these markers, but you can also do it directly inside After Effects (see the shorcuts below). There are a few options in the effects of the controller, to loop the animation, and to control how they may blend during transitions. You can control if they have to blend, the duration of the transition (in seconds), and how it is interpolated. The blend happens after the marker triggering the animation, between the animation of the marker and the previous one. To temporarily disable the Blender, you can disable the effect on the controller. This makes it easy to add new animations or modify the existing ones.

This makes it the cornerstone of the rigging process in Duik, which can be summarized to: Create Structures Auto-rig Animate As a smart tool, it will guess what you are trying to do, depending on the layers you have selected. It is able to add some \u201csimple\u201d IK or to rig a complete character in a single click. Note The Auto-rig is a tool in constant evolution. In each future version of Duik, it is going to work better and better, handling more different situations. To get started quickly with this process, just watch this jumpstart by Jake In Motion : Using the Auto-rig Select some layers in the composition. Click the \u201cAuto-rig & IK\u201d button. If there are Structures in the selection: If there are predefined limbs (arm, leg, spine or tail), the Auto-rig will rig everything for you, so you can start to animate right afterwards. If the Structures are custom Structures, the Auto-rig will add IKs to rig them, determining which type of IK would be the best according to the number and location of the layers. If the selection is made of standard layers , the Auto-rig will add IKs to rig them, trying to guess how they need to be rigged using their parenting and the location of their anchor points. If the layers are not parented yet, the Auto-rig is able to parent them automatically, but it\u2019s better in this case to select the layers in the right order: from the tip to the root of the limb (from hand to shoulder, or from foot to hip\u2026). IK and FK The most important constraints used by the Auto-rig to rig characters are IK and FK. Inverse Kinematics (IK) IK is a way to animate limbs by moving a controller located at the tip of the limb (i.e. at the hand or at the foot). This means that animating with IK uses positions, which are interpreted into the rotation of each part of the limb. This seems very natural when one manipulates it, but it is actually an advanced process. It is invaluable when the hand, or the foot, have interactions with anything else (like the foot interacting with the ground when the character walks). IK are the only way to animate the position of the hips while keeping the feet stuck on the ground, or the hand against a wall. But as animating with IK means animating positions, it is actually not the easiest nor the smartest way to animate limbs . It\u2019s needed when there are interactions, but in any other case (most of the cases for arms), you should prefer animating with FK. Animation by Jissse In this animation, you can see how the \u201chand\u201d is animated independently from the \u201cshoulder\u201d, which both animated using positions, without any rotation keyframe. This means that, for example, the hand can be fixed while the shoulder moves. Forward Kinematics (FK) FK is the most simple way to animate limbs: all parts are parented together, and you just have to animate the rotations of each parts. Rotation is way easier to animate than position: there\u2019s only one value, one axis, and you don\u2019t have to adjust trajectories, you can focus on speed and eases only. Ususally, when animating with FK, the animator wants to add follow-through and overlap . As these are very common in animation, FK controls created with Duik include an automatic follow-through and overlap tool (read below). IK / FK As both IK and FK can be useful, all IK created with Duik also include FK controls, and the animator can switch between FK and IK whenever he wants. The FK controls included in the IK effects even include an automatic follow-through and overlap . To make this process the easiest possible, an IK/FK Switch tool is provided with the animation tools . When the Auto-rig creates an IK / FK, it can be adjusted in the effects of the corresponding controller. The type of the IK can vary depending on the type and number of layers which were rigged. One-Layer IK (shoulder rotation, single-layer spine\u2026) Note This section still has to be written The Enable IK checkbox can be used to de-activate the IK and animate only using the FK control. !!! tip On this specific one-layer IK, you can animate in FK even without de-activating the IK. The layer controlled by the IK can even still be rotated manually too. The FK angle controls the rotation of the rigged layer. In the display section, you can customize the way the IK is shown by the controller, and how it displays some information. De-activating all these options will improve the performance. Two-layer IK (arms and legs\u2026) Note This section still has to be written The Enable IK checkbox can be used to de-activate the IK and animate only using the FK control. In the display section, you can customize the way the IK is shown by the controller, and how it displays some information. De-activating all these options will improve the performance. Bezier IK (multi-layer spine, tails\u2026) Note This section still has to be written Two controllers are needed to control Bezier IK. One at the end of the chain, like with other types of IK, and one in the middle which controls the curve. On both of these controllers there are some options in the effects. Main Controller (end) Middle Controller (curve) FK with follow-through, overlap and drag (tails\u2026) Note This section still has to be written This constraint autommatically controls the rotation of all the parts of the chain, depending on both the animation of the rotation of the controller and the motion of the parent of the chain. It rotates the children of the chain according the overlap and follow through animation principles. This means it mimics ropes, tails, hairs, etc. with the ability to adjust their flexibility and the resistance of the air or water where they are. Animation by Jissse In this example, there is an animation only on the rotation of the FK controller, and the motion of the tails is generated by the automatic follow-trough , drag and overlap of the controller. Controllers As opposed to previous versions of Duik, the Auto-rig in Duik Bassel is able to create any needed controllers to rig the selected layers, you do not necessarily have to create them yourself first. This being said, if you need or want to add and use a specific controller, you just have to include it in the layer selection before running the Auto-rig. It will automatically detect and use it. This is especially useful if, for example, you want to control two different IKs with the same controller. Tip Always have a look in the effects of the Controllers after having run the Auto-rig! Depending on what has been rigged, there may be a lot of options there. Additionnal panel The additionnal panel for the Auto-rig is divided in two parts: some options for the Auto-rig process itself, and some complementary tools ( Standard and Expert modes only). Options By default, the Auto-rig will \u201cbake\u201d the appearance of any Structure after it has rigged it. This is a way to improve performance in After Effects by removing all unneeded expressions, but it will prevent you from changing the appearance of the Structures after having run the Auto-rig. You can disable this option if you wish; baking the appearance of the Structures will still be possible through the Edit Structures panel (in Standard and Expert mode only). For long limbs (more than two or three layers), the autorig has to choose between standard IK, Bezier IK or FK. The default is FK - it is easier to achieve a nice and natural motion using the FK with overlap of Duik - but you may need IK in some cases, especially if the limb interacts with something else. For example if the dog\u2019s tail is caught in the door. Ouch. Complementary tools Hint Available in Standard and Expert modes only. Read above for a description of the effects added on the controllers. The IK button may be needed in very special occasions when the Auto-rig is not able to automatically create IK. There is an additionnal panel for the IK to let you choose how the IK for three layers have to be made: 1 and 2-layer IK (the default option) creates a combination of a one-layer and two-layer IK to rig the three layers with only one controller. This is the preferred way of rigging complex limbs like quadrupeds legs, as it allows a lot of controllers over each part of the limb. 3-layer IK creates a single IK for the three layers, which may seem easier to manipulate, but which is more limited in use. Bezier IK creates a Bezier IK without using the Auto-rig. In normal situations, as soons as there are more than two layers, the Auto-Rig will create a Bezier IK, but in some cases you may need some Bezier IK for only one or two layers; in this case, you can use this tool instead. FK Overlap rigs a chain of layers with a rotation controller (FK) with automatic follow-through and overlap .

For long limbs (more than two or three layers), the autorig has to choose between standard IK, Bezier IK or FK.

There is an additionnal panel for the IK to let you choose how the IK for three layers have to be made: 1 and 2-layer IK (the default option) creates a combination of a one-layer and two-layer IK to rig the three layers with only one controller. This is the preferred way of rigging complex limbs like quadrupeds legs, as it allows a lot of controllers over each part of the limb. 3-layer IK creates a single IK for the three layers, which may seem easier to manipulate, but which is more limited in use. Bezier IK creates a Bezier IK without using the Auto-rig. In normal situations, as soons as there are more than two layers, the Auto-Rig will create a Bezier IK, but in some cases you may need some Bezier IK for only one or two layers; in this case, you can use this tool instead.

This article is highly political, if you hate this word, or if you don\u2019t want to have any grasp on your own future and the one of your children, stop reading this right now. Or else, in the worst case, you\u2019ll waste a few precious minutes. In the ideal case, it may change the world. Please keep in mind that I\u2019m French, and my native language is French. And I\u2019m writing here about politics in English. When I started to develop my own softwares to help my own work in animation, it was just my own tools and nothing else. It was private and made my life better, it had no impact at all on other people\u2019s life. Well, to be honest, as I\u2019m not working alone, it quickly had a small impact on my colleagues too, easing their processes too. And then, I decided I could share those tools with the rest of the world, if the rest of the world was interested. And it was. The most well known of my tools, Duik, is now (early 2018) downloaded 1000 times a day, or something like that. Going from private to public made those tools political. I had to choose how they were going to impact other people\u2019s life. Everything is about choices. How I\u2019m struggling with my idealism. What was I going to do? I had a new product, I could just sell it like almost everything else in our capitalist society, or even better, I could rent it to keep my customers as hostages. But I had a unique occasion to think about my own impact on the world. There are a lot of things I don\u2019t like in our society: individualism, consumerism, competition\u2026 Everything is connected, intertwined. Economics, politics, it\u2019s just mechanics. Because our society is capitalist, it makes people individualist competitors and consumers. It\u2019s how things go. The question is: what will happen if we get really conscious of this? What will happen if we follow other ways? I chose to give away my tools. I chose to let people choose if it was worth paying for. I chose to do things in a less common way, maybe even a rare way: I chose to give away my tools. I chose not to earn money with them, or at least, I chose to let people choose if it was worth paying for. I chose freedom, for myself, and for the rest of the world. I chose to let my tools open source, I chose to let people get, use, and modify them freely, instead of being worried of stealers and pirates. I chose to make my stuff available even for the poorest human being on earth. Because I think my choices can have an impact. Because I think that if I work against capitalism and consumerism, if I show a different path, the path may be followed, and maybe, maybe it\u2019s a step to what I think is a better world. Politics, that\u2019s just politics. People are ready to accept a lot of things to be able to consume, but if they have the choice, they don\u2019t buy. They just consume. What I did not understand is that most people don\u2019t choose anything \u2013 and I belong to the people, I don\u2019t consider myself any different from what I\u2019m describing. Most people \u2013 including me, as I said \u2013 are consumers. If the softwares are free, most people just get them, consume them, ask for new features, ask for help, ask for support, but never help. That\u2019s our capitalist society, it\u2019s mechanical. People don\u2019t choose to pay for something free, people don\u2019t choose to contribute to the development of their own tools. People accept to pay when they have to, but people also accept to have their life invaded by advertising, people accept to give up their own privacy to be able to consume. People are ready to accept a lot of things to be able to consume, but if they have the choice, they don\u2019t buy. They just consume. It would be easy to sell my tools. It would be easy not to give the choice to others. But I chose a difficult path. I know that most people do not understand it, but I do not regret my choice, and I would do it again, even if I could be richer than I could have imagined. Numbers. Back to reality. It\u2019s a fact: we\u2019re all just consumers. I know that because I\u2019m lucid about myself: I\u2019m using a lot of free softwares, and services, that I did not contribute nor donate to. I also know that because of the numbers I have behind my famous piece of software. 1000 downloads per day but very few supporters in proportion. Duik is a big success. Hundreds of thousands of downloads so far (the last 5 years), an average of 1000 downloads per day, more than ten thousand daily users. It\u2019s a big success, with very few supporters. 250 backers during each of the crowd-funding campaigns, 120 supporters on Patreon (and those groups are overlapping, we can\u2019t even add the numbers). For thousands of users which the huge majority did not contribute with anything (But it makes supporters even more awesome, I can\u2019t thank you enough, dear supporters!). I would prefer so much that there were more supporters donating less\u2026 It\u2019s a big success, with even fewer contributors. I developed and wrote 99% of the code of Duik. There were three other contributors for some features and code writing, five people who helped translating into languages other than English and French. It\u2019s eight contributors at all, and I consider myself lucky (those too, I can\u2019t thank them enough). It\u2019s a big success but I\u2019m still struggling with money. I know everyone struggle for money, but at least 70% of the people in my country earn more than I do, and I work 50 hours a week on average, 6 or 7 days a week. Despite the fact that what I do is useful \u2013 and needed \u2013 by the people. Our capitalist society is like that, we don\u2019t reward people who do useful things, we value products based on an abstract market value, that\u2019s how capitalism works. Building something useful can\u2019t be our only goal if we want to survive. We either have to develop a business around it or\u2026 Find something else. Hundreds of users, maybe thousands, liked my latest posts on social networks, they were seen by thousands and shared by dozens \u2013 more than all the financial supporters and contributors I ever had. But I\u2019m lucid, you must be one of the 10%, maybe even less, who will read this\u2026 We\u2019re all just consumers Conclusion: I know for a fact we\u2019re all just consumers. Consume less and contribute more. Do politics. But I\u2019m not upset at all, I\u2019m not discouraged. Obviously, I don\u2019t do what I do for money. But I\u2019m not upset at all, I\u2019m not discouraged. Because I did things differently, I thought differently, I achieved something different. Obviously, I don\u2019t do what I do for money \u2013 but unfortunately money is a need, and I lack money. Why do I do all this? Why so many efforts? Because I chose not to be only a consumer, but I wanted to be a contributor. I don\u2019t want to consume life, I want to contribute to the society, because I believe society needs it. I\u2019m not waiting for someone to sell me what I need, I try to build what I need and then share it, before someone else sells it. I want to be able to explain what I did to the society, and be proud of it. Selling my softwares would not have been a contribution for the society, even if they\u2019re needed and successful, because it would not have pulled our community in what I think is the right direction. It would only give me the sensation I did something which matters, but it would not have been really useful for the community. It\u2019s not enough to make useful things, what\u2019s important is what we do with them, how we make them, how we share them. This is my point of view, and it matters. It matters that I have a point of view, it matters that I say it out loud. It matters that creating free software is a political gesture for me, because this means I\u2019m contributing to the community, because it means I asked myself a lot of questions about what I was doing and how it would impact others. I don\u2019t want to be like any consumer. After all, no, I\u2019m not so much like any consumer. I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m a contributor. A contributor to the community. It\u2019s an effort, it\u2019s harder than being a consumer, it\u2019s less rewarding on the short term, but way more in the long run, because I can be proud. Not rich, but legitimately proud. And finally, what I want you to know, is that it\u2019s actually not so hard. Please, join me! I understand you may not have time to create things like I did, of course I had the luck of being able to do it, I had the luck to be born where I was born, to have had a little spare time at some point in my life, to have had a good education\u2026 But it\u2019s not just luck, it\u2019s also choices. Political choices, choices which impact other people, ethic choices, for the better. Everyone can ask questions, everyone can be angry at things, everyone can think about individualism and consumerism. Everyone can \u2013 and has to \u2013 be upset about our society. Everyone can do politics. I\u2019m tired to feel I\u2019m part of a minority. Help me! Maybe you\u2019re already trying to change the world in your own way, or maybe you don\u2019t know how to do it. I just hope you\u2019ll all think about it now, that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. Do things in a way they matter and think about how they matter. Do what you can, no less, no more. We\u2019re enough people in the world to make the society change. Please, I\u2019m tired, and I need you to join me! There are a lot of concrete ways to contribute more and consume less, even without being a specialist. Most of all, think about what you\u2019re doing and how you can do it in a way that matters. Be political. Make choices. Don\u2019t let the system make choices before you do. Everything you do deserves that you ask yourself: \u201cHow can I do my stuff in a better way? Is there an alternative to consuming this product or this service?\u201d. Be uncompromising if you know what you\u2019re doing will make things better. There are no details, every little thing is important, there\u2019s so much we\u2019re fighting for, there\u2019s so much we\u2019re losing, we can not make compromises. Don\u2019t wait for someone to sell you what you need, try and build it whenever you can. And most of all, share it when it\u2019s done. Don\u2019t do things just for yourself. There\u2019s surely someone else who has the same needs than you. Ask yourself: how can I share with those people, even if they don\u2019t have money. Learn. To be able to develop Duik, I had to learn coding. I did not knew shit about computer science before I tried to develop my tools, I did not learn this at school. Each and every thing you learn is a political gesture too. The more you learn, the more impact you can have. Teach. Help others learn. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re not alone, and I learned much more by teaching than when I was at school. Use your language, maybe you can translate things to make them available to more people (maybe you can translate this very article?). You\u2019re a user, maybe you can provide some constructive feedback, not based on what you want and need, but thinking about what the community may need based on your experience. Contribute financially to projects which matter (which have an impact, which pull the community in the direction you think is right, not only because of what they do, but more importantly how they do it). It\u2019s much needed as our society do not reward things based on their impact, but only on their market value. Be an example, spread the word, convince people, share this article, exactly like what I am doing right now. Every public thing is political and deserves to be discussed. Be annoying, be angry, be upset. Etc.","title":"Be Annoying!"},{"location":"be-annoying.html#be-annoying-be-angry-be-upset-help-me","text":"Warning!

I understand you may not have time to create things like I did, of course I had the luck of being able to do it, I had the luck to be born where I was born, to have had a little spare time at some point in my life, to have had a good education\u2026 But it\u2019s not just luck, it\u2019s also choices. Political choices, choices which impact other people, ethic choices, for the better. Everyone can ask questions, everyone can be angry at things, everyone can think about individualism and consumerism. Everyone can \u2013 and has to \u2013 be upset about our society. Everyone can do politics. I\u2019m tired to feel I\u2019m part of a minority. Help me! Maybe you\u2019re already trying to change the world in your own way, or maybe you don\u2019t know how to do it. I just hope you\u2019ll all think about it now, that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. Do things in a way they matter and think about how they matter. Do what you can, no less, no more. We\u2019re enough people in the world to make the society change. Please, I\u2019m tired, and I need you to join me! There are a lot of concrete ways to contribute more and consume less, even without being a specialist. Most of all, think about what you\u2019re doing and how you can do it in a way that matters. Be political. Make choices. Don\u2019t let the system make choices before you do. Everything you do deserves that you ask yourself: \u201cHow can I do my stuff in a better way? Is there an alternative to consuming this product or this service?\u201d. Be uncompromising if you know what you\u2019re doing will make things better. There are no details, every little thing is important, there\u2019s so much we\u2019re fighting for, there\u2019s so much we\u2019re losing, we can not make compromises. Don\u2019t wait for someone to sell you what you need, try and build it whenever you can. And most of all, share it when it\u2019s done. Don\u2019t do things just for yourself. There\u2019s surely someone else who has the same needs than you. Ask yourself: how can I share with those people, even if they don\u2019t have money. Learn. To be able to develop Duik, I had to learn coding. I did not knew shit about computer science before I tried to develop my tools, I did not learn this at school. Each and every thing you learn is a political gesture too. The more you learn, the more impact you can have. Teach. Help others learn. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re not alone, and I learned much more by teaching than when I was at school. Use your language, maybe you can translate things to make them available to more people (maybe you can translate this very article?). You\u2019re a user, maybe you can provide some constructive feedback, not based on what you want and need, but thinking about what the community may need based on your experience. Contribute financially to projects which matter (which have an impact, which pull the community in the direction you think is right, not only because of what they do, but more importantly how they do it). It\u2019s much needed as our society do not reward things based on their impact, but only on their market value. Be an example, spread the word, convince people, share this article, exactly like what I am doing right now. Every public thing is political and deserves to be discussed. Be annoying, be angry, be upset.

With the connector, a \u201cmaster property\u201d will drive one or several \u201cslave properties\u201d and automate their animation depending on the master property value. It is very useful in three cases: Every time you need a causal link between a property and some other properties. For example \u201cwhen the arm bends, the cloth has to adapt\u201d: this means you can use the connector to drive the shape of the cloth with the rotation of the forearm. It is very powerful to quickly connect sliders and other controllers to any properties, and for example control a head turn from a single value like the X position of a controller or a slider. You can use it to control opacities of layers with a single property, for example to control phonemes with the position of a controller. The slave property has to be prepared with keyframes, and the master property will drive this animation a bit like if you were using time remapping on the slave property, in a similar way to the \u201cset driven keys\u201d in Autodesk Maya. When the master property value is at the predefined minimum, the child property value is the one at the start of its animation, and when the master property value is at the predefined maximum, the child property value is at the end of its animation. Property types handled by the connector As the connector uses the same principle as time remapping, it is able to connect almost any type of property to any other type of property, which makes it a very powerful tool, even on older versions of After Effects. Slave (controlled) property The slave property can be of any type which can be animated with keyframes and have an expression (numerical and spatial values, shapes, texts\u2026) Master (controller) property The master property can be of any numerical type (but can be multi-dimentionnal): Slider Angle Position Scale Opacity Color etc. That said, Duik provides several pre-rigged and very useful controllers which are meant to be used with the connector. Slider, 2D Slider, Angle These are layers which provide a nice UI in the composition panel to control your animation. They\u2019re especially used for facial rigging, but can be nice for a lot of different things. Spatial Effector and Effector Map The Effector is a intuitive way to spatially control the slave properties, as the Effector Map does the same but using the color or alpha channel from a texture layer. Expose Transform The Expose Transform tool is an object (a controller) which will measure and expose angles, orientations, coordinates and distances between two layers . Hint The IK effect on controllers exposes the distance between the end and the root of the limb, which may be very useful with the connector, to connect anything to the bending of the limb. IK If you pick a controller with an IK effect, the connector is able to connect either the IK Length, the stretch of the upper part of the limb or the stretch of the lower part of the limb. How to set the connector up Quick setup To set the connector up ver quickly, you can do it the quick way: It is advised to first add the needed keyframes on the slave properties, though this can be done or modified afterwards. Just animate the slave property as you need it to change when the master (controller) property goes from its minimum to its maximum. Select the slave properties in the composition Click the \u201cConnector\u201d button Duik will create or use any preexisting \u201cConnector\u201d controller, and add a slider in the effects of this layer. This slider is a simple percent ranging from 0 to 100 which will control the selected properties. This is the simplest and quickiest way to use the connector. If you need to have the controller in another composition, you can either use the \u201cExtract controllers\u201d tool from the parent composition, or just copy and paste the controller to the new composition, and link the percent with an expression, simply using the pickwhip. Read further to learn how to do more advanced stuff with the connector, in the additionnal panel. Standard setup Using the standard setup, you can do more things than the quick setup, like connecting from a composition to another, and be able to choose almost any property as a controller (see the section above, Property types handled by the connector ). It is advised to first add the needed keyframes on the slave property, though this can be done or modified afterwards. Just animate the slave property as you need it to change when the master property goes from its minimum to its maximum. a. Select the master property in the timeline, and click on \u201cPick Master Property\u201d. The name of the master property will be shown on the button. b. You can also use one of the 4 controllers of Duik especially made to be used by the connector (the slider, the 2D slider, the angle and the spatial effector) Depending on the type of the master property, you can select the axis (or the channel if it\u2019s a color) to be used to control the slave properties. Choose between the value or the velocity of the master property to control the slave properties. Using the velocity can be very useful for example to control how the antenna of a car rotates depending on the speed of its X position. Set the minimum and maximum value of the master property. Click either on \u201cConnect to selected properties\u201d or \u201cConnect to selected layers opacities\u201d. The latter can be used to control the display of a bunch of layers with a slider: it\u2019s a good way to switch predefined phonemes for a mouth with a controller for example. It is exactly like using time remapping on a composition containing a layer sequence, but without all the issues caused by using actual time remapping. After these few steps, everything is ready: as soon as the master property changes, the slave properties will be driven. You can change all the settings afterwards in the effects of the master layer. If you need to adjust the keyframes on the slave properties, you can temporarily deactivate the connector by disabling the corresponding connector effect on the master layer. Multiple connections You often have to connect the same slave property to multiple master properties. For example, this happens when rigging a head turn to control the left-right turn with the X position of a controller and the up-down turn with its Y position. In this case, you have a different connection for each axis, on the same properties. There are different ways of achieving this, depending on the type of the slave property. For transformation properties (i.e. position, rotation and scale), the quickiest and easiest way is to use parents : for each new connection, add a null layer, and parent the already connected layer to this null. You can then connect the transformation of the null object, and you can repeat this process for each new connection you want to make. For other numerical properties (including transformations too) you can use the list tool of Duik, which is available in the link & constraints panel (in standard and expert mode only, it is hidden in rookie mode ). Just select the property, and click the list button. Duik will add an effect with 5 new properties to control the original property, allowing up to five connections (or even more if you add a list to the list\u2026). With the list, you won\u2019t connect the original property, but one of the new properties in the list effect. And there are non-numerical properties, like Bezier paths \u2026 If you\u2019re using an version of After EFfects older than CC2018 , it can be a bit tricky: with older versions, there is no way to efficiently work with shapes in expressions, so you can not do more than one single connection to the shapes (to your X or Y slider, but not both). The only way to achieve this is by duplicating the bezier path and try to make it work, combining the two of them, but it can be very difficult. Using masks can help : instead of connecting the original shape itself, you can connect masks which \u201ccut\u201d it, or with shape layers try using multiple shapes and the \u201cmerge path\u201d option (which works like the pathfinder of Adobe Illustrator). If your using CC2018 or any more recent version , you can add bones to the bezier path (select the path property, or any vertex of the path, and click on the \u201cadd bones\u201d button in the links & constraints panel of Duik). This way you\u2019ll have one layer for each vertex (and tangent) of the path, and you can then connect the position properties of these bones, and get back to the first and second method (connecting transformations or numerical properties). Examples Automating the cloth when the arm bends With an arm already rigged, made of shapes (either shape layers or masks on solids): Animate the rig so the arm is straight at the beginning of the comp, and bent at its maximum a couple seconds later. If it\u2019s possible, animate only the FK of the forearm so the animation is the most simple it can be, and to isolate the effect of the forearm on the cloth only, as its just a reference to draw the shape of the cloth. Animate the shape(s) of the arm and forearm so the cloth looks nice during the whole animation. Feel free to add as many keyframes as needed and use eases! Select the rotation property of the structure of the forearm. This is the property which exposes how the arm is bent, no matter what, in FK as in IK. Click on the \u201cPick master property\u201d button of the panel of the connector. a. Set the minimum to the rotation value of the structure of the forearm at the beginning of the composition, when the arm is straight. b. Set the maximum value to the rotation value of the structure of the forearm at the end of the animation, when the arm is completely bent. c. Note that Duik will try to automatically set these values, reading the existing animation of the master property if any. Select the shape(s) used to draw the cloth (and now animated). Click on the \u201cConnect to properties\u201d button. Now you can remove the animation of the arm (but NOT the animation of the shapes which is needed by the connector) You\u2019re all set! Now you can animate the arm as you wish, the cloth will correctly adjust. Controlling a head turn With a precomposed head: Animate anything you need to turn the head from left to right in the precomposition of the head. a. To control this head turn, we will not use an existing property, but create a nice controller just for it: b. Go to the main composition, from where you will animate the head c. In the panel of the connector, click on the \u201cSlider\u201d button Select ALL the animated properties of the head turn in the precomposition of the head. Click on the \u201cConnect to properties\u201d button. That\u2019s it! Now when you move the slider from left to right, the head turns! Controlling phonemes for a mouth You can connect the position of a controller to phonemes. You must have one layer for each phoneme: Select the controller\u2019s position Click on the \u201cPick master property\u201d button of the panel of the connector. Set the minimum value corresponding to the position of the controller where the first mouth must be displayed. Set the maximum value corresponding to the position of the controller where the last mouth must be displayed. Select the mouth/phonemes layers. Click on the \u201cConnect to opacities\u201d button of the connector. Et voil\u00e0! Move the controller to change which phoneme is displayed. Tip You can add a background behind the controller showing all the phonemes to know what you are selecting.

It is very useful in three cases: Every time you need a causal link between a property and some other properties. For example \u201cwhen the arm bends, the cloth has to adapt\u201d: this means you can use the connector to drive the shape of the cloth with the rotation of the forearm. It is very powerful to quickly connect sliders and other controllers to any properties, and for example control a head turn from a single value like the X position of a controller or a slider. You can use it to control opacities of layers with a single property, for example to control phonemes with the position of a controller. The slave property has to be prepared with keyframes, and the master property will drive this animation a bit like if you were using time remapping on the slave property, in a similar way to the \u201cset driven keys\u201d in Autodesk Maya.

Select the slave properties in the composition Click the \u201cConnector\u201d button Duik will create or use any preexisting \u201cConnector\u201d controller, and add a slider in the effects of this layer. This slider is a simple percent ranging from 0 to 100 which will control the selected properties. This is the simplest and quickiest way to use the connector. If you need to have the controller in another composition, you can either use the \u201cExtract controllers\u201d tool from the parent composition, or just copy and paste the controller to the new composition, and link the percent with an expression, simply using the pickwhip.

It is advised to first add the needed keyframes on the slave property, though this can be done or modified afterwards. Just animate the slave property as you need it to change when the master property goes from its minimum to its maximum. a. Select the master property in the timeline, and click on \u201cPick Master Property\u201d. The name of the master property will be shown on the button. b. You can also use one of the 4 controllers of Duik especially made to be used by the connector (the slider, the 2D slider, the angle and the spatial effector) Depending on the type of the master property, you can select the axis (or the channel if it\u2019s a color) to be used to control the slave properties. Choose between the value or the velocity of the master property to control the slave properties. Using the velocity can be very useful for example to control how the antenna of a car rotates depending on the speed of its X position. Set the minimum and maximum value of the master property. Click either on \u201cConnect to selected properties\u201d or \u201cConnect to selected layers opacities\u201d. The latter can be used to control the display of a bunch of layers with a slider: it\u2019s a good way to switch predefined phonemes for a mouth with a controller for example. It is exactly like using time remapping on a composition containing a layer sequence, but without all the issues caused by using actual time remapping. After these few steps, everything is ready: as soon as the master property changes, the slave properties will be driven. You can change all the settings afterwards in the effects of the master layer. If you need to adjust the keyframes on the slave properties, you can temporarily deactivate the connector by disabling the corresponding connector effect on the master layer.","title":"Standard setup"},{"location":"connector.html#multiple-connections","text":"You often have to connect the same slave property to multiple master properties. For example, this happens when rigging a head turn to control the left-right turn with the X position of a controller and the up-down turn with its Y position. In this case, you have a different connection for each axis, on the same properties. There are different ways of achieving this, depending on the type of the slave property. For transformation properties (i.e. position, rotation and scale), the quickiest and easiest way is to use parents : for each new connection, add a null layer, and parent the already connected layer to this null. You can then connect the transformation of the null object, and you can repeat this process for each new connection you want to make. For other numerical properties (including transformations too) you can use the list tool of Duik, which is available in the link & constraints panel (in standard and expert mode only, it is hidden in rookie mode ). Just select the property, and click the list button. Duik will add an effect with 5 new properties to control the original property, allowing up to five connections (or even more if you add a list to the list\u2026). With the list, you won\u2019t connect the original property, but one of the new properties in the list effect. And there are non-numerical properties, like Bezier paths \u2026 If you\u2019re using an version of After EFfects older than CC2018 , it can be a bit tricky: with older versions, there is no way to efficiently work with shapes in expressions, so you can not do more than one single connection to the shapes (to your X or Y slider, but not both). The only way to achieve this is by duplicating the bezier path and try to make it work, combining the two of them, but it can be very difficult. Using masks can help : instead of connecting the original shape itself, you can connect masks which \u201ccut\u201d it, or with shape layers try using multiple shapes and the \u201cmerge path\u201d option (which works like the pathfinder of Adobe Illustrator). If your using CC2018 or any more recent version , you can add bones to the bezier path (select the path property, or any vertex of the path, and click on the \u201cadd bones\u201d button in the links & constraints panel of Duik). This way you\u2019ll have one layer for each vertex (and tangent) of the path, and you can then connect the position properties of these bones, and get back to the first and second method (connecting transformations or numerical properties).","title":"Multiple connections"},{"location":"connector.html#examples","text":"","title":"Examples"},{"location":"connector.html#automating-the-cloth-when-the-arm-bends","text":"With an arm already rigged, made of shapes (either shape layers or masks on solids): Animate the rig so the arm is straight at the beginning of the comp, and bent at its maximum a couple seconds later.

As all the other tools in Duik Bassel, the Struture creation tools try to be smart, and change their behaviour depending on the context (i.e. the current selection in the current composition). You can create either complete characters (e.g. Homono\u00efds\u2026), single limbs (e.g. Arms, Legs\u2026), or custom structures. Except for complete characters , the way the Structures are created will change depending on the selection. Complete characters are always created in the center of the composition, and nothing is linked to the new Structure , you\u2019ll have to make the links between the artwork and the Structures by yourself later. Without any selection in the composition, predefined limbs and custom Structures will also be created in the center of the composition, but with a selection, they will be moved to the selected properties or layers, which, by default, will be linked to the Structure elements . If Bezier path properties (i.e. mask path or shape path) are selected, one Structure will be created for each path , with one Structure element for each vertex of the path. Vertex and tangents will both be linked to the corresponding Structure elements , but there is no individual control for tangents. You can create them later if you need with the Bones tool. Note As Structures can be created on a bezier path with any version of After Effects, paths can be linked back to the Structures only on After Effects CC2018 and newer. If puppet pins are selected, one Structure will be created for each layer , with one Structure element for each puppet pin. The order of the elements of the Structure depends on the order of the pins in the layer stack. You can re-order them before creating the Structure to adjust how the Structure is created and parented. Puppet pins will be linked to the corresponding Structure elements . If layers are selected, without any other property, one Structure will be created . Each Structure element will be moved to a corresponding layer, and the layer will be parented to it. Note If there are selected layers with their anchor points at the same location in the composition, the Structure will not use the layers\u2019 position, and layers will not be parented, to avoid weird issues happening when layers share the same anchor point in the same Structure chain. Hint You can separately deactivate the automatic linking of layers, pins and paths to the Structure elements in the edition panel of the Structures . In this case, holding the [Ctrl] key when creating Structures will enable you to temporarily force this automatic linking.

Internal unique identifiers are associated with the Structures , which won\u2019t be updated when you copy or duplicate the Structures in After Effects.

Hominoid This tool will create Structures for a complete hominoid with a spine, two legs and two arms, using the settings of the individual limbs set in the Structures panel. Note Hominoids (Hominoidea) are a branch of tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes (orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, humans). Hint [ Alt + Click ] on the button for a demo of what Duik can do! Types of walking animals The rig, and the animation, of the animal you\u2019re working on depends a lot on how it walks. There are three main ways of walking among vertebrates. Type Description Examples Notes Plantigrade Animals which put the whole foot on the ground, with the heel touching the ground when they walk. Primates, bears, rabbits\u2026 The ones nearly equal to humans. Digitigrade Animals which walk on their fingers. Dogs and all canines, cats and other felines, dinosaurs, walking birds\u2026 The friends of humans. Ungulate Animals which walk on the tip of their fingers, who usually have hoofs. Horses, cattle, girafes, pigs, deers, camels, hippopotamuses\u2026 The ones humans eat. For each limb you can create with Duik, you have to choose the type of walking animal it is (for arms and legs), and which parts of the limbs must be created. Arm Creates a Structure for the arm or the front leg of a quadruped. Click the \u25cb button to adjust the settings for the arm. You can check which part of the limb is present on your character. The autorig will adapt to every configuration, but using all of them (except for claws when rigging humans) can ensure a nice rig and a more realistic animation. Animation by Jissse Leg Creates a Structure for the (rear) leg of a biped or a quadruped. Click the \u25cb button to adjust the settings for the leg. The autorig will adapt to every configuration, but using all of them can ensure a nice rig and a more realistic animation (with a proper foot roll). Spine Creates a Structure for the spine of any vertebrate. Click the \u25cb button to adjust the settings for the spine. You can check which part of the spine is present on your character. You can divide the spine and the neck in as many layers as you want (or none). The autorig will adapt to every configuration. Tail Create a Structure for the tail of any animal. Click the \u25cb button to adjust the settings for the tail. You can divide the tail in as many layers as you want. The autorig will adapt to every configuration. Illustration by Jissse With tails, you can even rig fishes very easily. Tip In the Autorig options, you can choose between rigging tails using Bezier IK controls or FK (with automatic follow through and overlap) controls. The latter achieves a natural motion more easily, but IK could be needed in some cases, like if the tail interacts with anything else. Custom Structure Creates a standard, custom Structure . You can set the number of elements in the Structure, and choose a name for it. Hint Hold the [Alt] button on your keyboard to assign a new random color to the Structure .","title":"Create Structures"},{"location":"create-structures.html#create-structures","text":"There are several ways to create Structures with Duik, depending on what you need. As all the other tools in Duik Bassel, the Struture creation tools try to be smart, and change their behaviour depending on the context (i.e. the current selection in the current composition). You can create either complete characters (e.g. Homono\u00efds\u2026), single limbs (e.g. Arms, Legs\u2026), or custom structures. Except for complete characters , the way the Structures are created will change depending on the selection. Complete characters are always created in the center of the composition, and nothing is linked to the new Structure , you\u2019ll have to make the links between the artwork and the Structures by yourself later. Without any selection in the composition, predefined limbs and custom Structures will also be created in the center of the composition, but with a selection, they will be moved to the selected properties or layers, which, by default, will be linked to the Structure elements . If Bezier path properties (i.e. mask path or shape path) are selected, one Structure will be created for each path , with one Structure element for each vertex of the path. Vertex and tangents will both be linked to the corresponding Structure elements , but there is no individual control for tangents. You can create them later if you need with the Bones tool. Note As Structures can be created on a bezier path with any version of After Effects, paths can be linked back to the Structures only on After Effects CC2018 and newer. If puppet pins are selected, one Structure will be created for each layer , with one Structure element for each puppet pin. The order of the elements of the Structure depends on the order of the pins in the layer stack. You can re-order them before creating the Structure to adjust how the Structure is created and parented. Puppet pins will be linked to the corresponding Structure elements . If layers are selected, without any other property, one Structure will be created . Each Structure element will be moved to a corresponding layer, and the layer will be parented to it. Note If there are selected layers with their anchor points at the same location in the composition, the Structure will not use the layers\u2019 position, and layers will not be parented, to avoid weird issues happening when layers share the same anchor point in the same Structure chain. Hint You can separately deactivate the automatic linking of layers, pins and paths to the Structure elements in the edition panel of the Structures . In this case, holding the [Ctrl] key when creating Structures will enable you to temporarily force this automatic linking. Warning Never duplicate nor copy and paste Structures in After Effects, always create new Structures or use the Duplicate button in the Structures panel of Duik. Internal unique identifiers are associated with the Structures , which won\u2019t be updated when you copy or duplicate the Structures in After Effects.

This means each tab of Duik can be now in its own panel and docked separately into the user interface of After Effects. Individual panels can be opened by [Alt] + [Click] on the tab buttons. Included with this individual panels: Duik Cmd , a tiny UI with a simple command line interface for Duik. Duik now uses a welcome screen at startup, which greatly improves launch time. In order to fix any problem with Duik, like its settings file getting corrupted sometimes on Mac, there\u2019s now a way to re-initialize everything . Added some buttons with useful links: At the bottom of the panel: Bug Report and Feature Request In the help window: Forum and Live Chat New (Links & Constraints) A tool to Separate Dimensions of any property, including colors which can be animated both as RGB or HSL. The Auto-Parent tool helps you parent layers very quickly. The additional panel for the Bone now includes a button to select and show or hide all the bones in the composition. The Connector now works with a spatial effector, a texture effector or the new Expose Transform tool too. The Expose Transform tool is very useful with the Connector or to build your own expressions and automate a lot of stuff. The IK effect on controllers now exposes the distance between the end and the root of the limb, which may be very useful with the connector or in your own expressions. New (Automations) The new Effector Map tool is able to connect any property to a texture effector. New (Controllers) A tag controller tool to set any layer so Duik can recognise it as a controller (very useful for the extract controllers tool for example). Hold the [Alt] button when creating controllers to create only one controller centered on the average positions of the selected layers. Hold the [Ctrl] button to automatically parent the selected layers to the newly created controller(s). New (Other rigging tools) A tool to Align Layers in the rigging tools panel. With the Edit mode , you can (un/re)parent all the children of a layer. You can Remove expressions while keeping the post-expression value. It is easy to Copy & Paste Expressions without changing the current value of several properties at once with the copy and paste expressions buttons. Some other advanced rigging tools have been added, useful for those who create their own expressions or scripts (expert mode only): You can get some Property Info about the selected property, like its index, its matchName, the expression link to it, etc. A Scriptify expression tool makes it quick to include an expression as a string in a .jsx script. New (Other) Reimplemented and improved the TVPaint import tool from Duik 15. Duik now also imports JSON exported from TVPaint 11+, in a simpler and stabler way than the script provided by TVPaint (and with the ability to choose which layers to import). Added German translation . The interpolation adjustment tools in the Keyframes has been greatly improved, with sliders for velocity and buttons with useful predefined values. Improvements The Connector can now be used in a single click (creates a controller layer automatically). The Connector User Interface for the additionnal panel has been improved a bit to be clearer and easier to use. When used on opacities, the Connector automatically makes the layer visible. When Structures are created with something selected in the composition (Bezier paths, puppet pins, or layers), Duik will try to create these Structures on the selection and name them after the selected elements. If you hold the [Ctrl] key and there was a selection (path, pins or layers) in the composition when creating Structures , Duik will automatically link (parent or expression) the selection to the Structures . The head controller with the Autorig now controls the head position too. The preferences (and language files) of Duik are now saved by default in a \u201cDuik\u201d subfolder of your \u201cDocuments\u201d folder, instead of directly in the \u201cDocuments\u201d folder. You can still change the location of the preferences in the settings panel of Duik. The Structures colors for predefined limbs have been improved to better show the hierarchy. The User Interface has been tweaked to fix some details and improve the overall User Experience. All buttons for showing or hiding stuff (Structures, bones, controllers\u2026) can now invert the visibility with holding the [Alt] button, instead of showing or hiding them all. The Structures layer names are now translated to the language set in the settings (if the translation file is up-to-date). The Path Constraint effect now has a \u201c Path Offset \u201d option. The Add Bones button now creates a single bone if nothing is selected, which you can then use any way you want. The performance of the Search and Replace tool has been slightly improved for expressions. There\u2019s still some ongoing work to dramatically improve it\u2019s performance. Controllers as null layers are 3D layers when the selected layer is 3D. The Path Constraint can now be created in a single click. Fixes The version of Duik is now checked correctly (even for alpha and beta tests), and there is no warning if the version installed is the same than the available one. The extract controllers tool now takes the precomposition start time into account in the links, thus you can safely move the precomposed character in time. The Search and replace now correctly ignores locked layers. Adding Bones on shapes on a layer which already has some effects now works correctly. The Parent Constraint now works correctly when the composition start time is not 0. Auto-rig freezing when there\u2019s only one layer selected. Fixed some bugs when creating IK on standard layers instead of Structures . The show/hide button for Structures now works correctly. Fixed the scale expression for the 2D Camera . The Wheel and Parent Constraint now correctly generate motion blur (which can be adjusted to fix performance issues). Fixed animations not importing when interpolation values are invalid. Fixed 3D Controllers extraction . The List does not anymore add an offset on the value when added on a property without keyframes. The Move Away does not generate an expression error anymore when the layer is at the same location as its parent. Some checkboxes not working in the UI are fixed. Duik is now launched correctly on first launch if the File and Network Preference of After Effects was unchecked. The Walk Cycle is now applied correctly when controllers are null layers. Controllers are extracted without generating expression errors when using master properties. The Paint Rig now works correctly with the cloner and eraser tool too. Fixed the expressions errors in the 2D Camera on non-English After Effects. 16.0.12 Fixes Fixed the Parent constraint expressions not working with the new Javascript enginge. Fixed the Check for updates failing at first start, always stating that a new version is available when it\u2019s not. Fixed the Structures creation failing in huge comps. Fixed the expression errors using the new JavaScript engine with the Framing guides . Fixed the rotation in the Camera Rig . 16.0.11 Fixes Fixed the Connector when an angle is used as a controller property and in some cases there is a jump of 360 degrees, and IK rotation values. Fixed some Structures bugs with the new JavaScript expression engine. Fixed Scale Z-Link . Fixed the Randomize tool when used on keyframe times in absolute mode. Fixed the walk cycle with the new JavaScript expression engine. 16.0.10 Improvements [Alt + Click] on the Zero button resets the position, rotation and scale of the layer. The User Interface has been tweaked to make it always better. Fixes When picking properties with Duik tools, if there is a disabled expression, it stays disabled instead of being enabled by the tool. UI: The buttons can now be clicked anywhere and not only on the text or the icon (except on CS6). Fixed the issue when sometimes two Bones were created for the same puppet pin. Fixed the expressions for the walk cycle with the new expression engine. If errors are still generated, you can jut ignore them, they\u2019ll disappear as soon as you use the controller. Slider, 2D-slider and angle controllers are no longer broken when there are layers selected in the composition before creating them. 16.0.9 Fixes The Spring expressions have been fixed and improved for After Effects 16.0 Copy/Paste animation , which was broken in 16.0.8, is fixed The Extract controllers can now extract the controllers from two rigs in the same composition. Bones on puppet pins are named after the correponding pin. Fixed Bones creation on pins with Ae CC2018 and older. The Storyboarder importer now imports empty boards too. 16.0.8 Fixes The Walk Cycle now works with the new expression engine in After Effects 16.0 16.0.7 Fixes The rigging tools panel is displaying again. Adding Bones on scaled layers no longer moves them to another location. 16.0.6 New The Bones can control the new puppet pins in After Effects 16.0: they handle the rotation and scale of the pins too. Improvements Expressions used by Duik have been improved for the new expression engine in After Effects 16.0 Fixes Random tool now correctly sets values on animated properties. Parent Constraint now works when the dimensions of the position are separated. Storyboarder import fixed (again). Extract Controllers now works correctly when dimensions are separated on the controllers. Extract Controllers now longer has an expression error on foot roll effects. The anchor size of the Controllers can now be set to 0% without generating an expression error. Fixed the Time remap tool. The parent used in a Parent contraint can now be scaled to 0% without generating an expression error. Fixed a bunch of minor bugs, stability improved. Overall stability improved (especially regarding composition names and links accross compositions). 16.0.5 New Chinese translation, thanks to eZioPan. Re-implemented the Lock Property tool from Duik 15 (in the constraints panel, Standard and Expert mode only). Improvements The Effector layer is now created as a guide layer. Fixes 2D Camera no longer crashes if there\u2019s no active composition. Extract controllers no longer fails when launched from the additionnal panel of the tool. Extract controllers and other tools are more robust and should throw less errors in unusual cases. IK/FK Switch now works with controllers extracted from a precomposition. Walk Cycle now works with controllers extracted from a precomposition. Some labels could not be translated in the User Interface and stayed in English. This is now fixed and everything should be translated in upcoming versions. Fixed some stability issues, and made some small performance improvements. Fixed the tools not working if the composition is selected from the project panel and the composition in the viewer is not the same. 16.0.4 Fixes Duik now really imports correctly Wonderunit Storyboarder files made with the latest version. 16.0.3 Fixes Duik now imports correctly Wonderunit Storyboarder files made with the latest version. 16.0.2 Improvements Duik now checks for updates and reads the news only once a day. Fixes The Framing guides are now created as guide layers. There is no longer any error when the serveur for news and updates is unavailable. 16.0.1 Fixes Fixed the Connector used with a master property which has one dimension only. 16.0.0 Improvements The Select Keyframes now works like the other tools, in a single click with an additionnal panel for the settings Parent Accross Comps now locks and hides the locators Changed controllers\u2019 label Changed structures\u2019 label Structures are selected after duplication The scale of Structures is now locked The Connector now detects the same pre-existing effects and uses them instead of creating new ones Parent Accross Comps now creates a single locator instead of one locator per child. Completed French translation Completed Documentation (but without screenshots, and still needs more details) Fixes Fixed performance issue with the Copy/paste anim (when reversed keyframes is checked). Fixed Select Keyframes tool with properties with separated dimensions. Fixed translations loading Fixed the Arm Autorig without shoulder Fixed Autorig on previously duplicated Strucutures Fixed the list not getting the initial value of the property Fixed the Autorig not detecting the side of the legs Fixed Add Bones freezing when selecting non spatial properties or groups Fixed Position Constraint which now works correctly even with parenting on the constrained layer. Fixed the automatic position of shoulders with the Autorig Fixed the neck and shoulder rotating away from their original orientation with the Autorig Fixed the Autorig run on duplicated structures Removed debug alert when using the Wiggle on single dimensionnal properties 16.0.0-RC2 Improvements Huge performance improvement at startup, with help from Lars Jandel (again). The Auto-rig is smarter: it can rig a mix between predefined limbs and custom structures UI tweaks Fixes Fixed Bezier IK and Spine Auto-rig strange behavior 16.0.0-RC1 Improvements Extract Controllers now able to extract all controllers, including the ones which are parented to any other layer, thanks to the new Parent Accross Comps tool. You now have the option to use null layers for controllers instead of shape layers ( Standard and Expert modes only) Duik can now be launched without the \u201cFile and network access\u201d preference (but with limited features and without icons). All dialogs at first start have been removed to be included in the main panel of Duik itself. Duik now checks for updates at startup (like previous versions) The help panel now includes \u201c news \u201d and \u201c about \u201d tabs to know more about Duik and Rainbox. The user guide and contextual help have been updated with a lot of new documentation. The Calculator has been removed. Lots of UI tweaks and improvements Fixes Animation Panel : the ease slider now automatically change linear keyframes to bezier with velocity set to 0. Clicking the Autorig & IK button no longer crashes Duik when there are no active composition. Duik should now work properly in Mac OS with network sessions (?). Please confirm if it\u2019s your case ;) Fixed startup in Mac OS. Fixed file extensions with exports in Mac OS Exporting to Audition with transcoding now works in Mac OS 16.0.0-Beta-1 New Duplicate Structures easily with a single button. Export and Import Animations re-implemented from Duik 15. Improvements Wonder Unit Storyboarder now handles PSD boards. Looper now has a parameter to set the number of keyframes to loop. Several FK Over IK improvements (A checkbox to disable Automatic Follow Through, animate the goal in the individual controls\u2026) Legs rigged with the Autorig and a foot roll can now be switched to FK. This is a huge improvement for walk cycle animations: as soon as the foot leaves the ground, you can swith to FK and animate very simply the rotations of the leg. Position Constraint : default weight to 0% to prevent layers from \u201cjumping\u201d away when setting the constraint. Import Animation : option to offset the values from the current ones. Import Animation : option to import all property values, or only the properties with keyframes. Import Animation : filters on property types: import only the position, or rotation, or shapes, or everything\u2026 Import Animation : option to replace existing animation or just add the new keyframes Copy/Paste Animation : option to offset the values from the current ones. Copy/Paste Animation : option to replace existing animation or just add the new keyframes Copy/Paste Animation : option to reverse keyframes Fixes Fixed the keyboard shortcuts for the Bones button in the options panel. Bones : tangents width for the bones created on shapes (CC2018) is now adjusted with the size parameter of the bone. Bones have better names when the name is too long. Fixed locator names in the Parent Accross Comps tool Fixed the character encoding issue in the contextual help on Macintosh Several Walk Cycle fixes 16.0.0-Alpha-10 New Contextual Help : Shift+Click on any tool to get some help. Animation blender is a new tool to animate using markers to trigger animations. Setup a composition with some animations and the Animation Blender , and then you just have to add some markers on the controller to trigger the animations, with an optionnal nice blending between each animation and the ability to loop them. Framing Guides in the Camera panel: creates handy guides in the composition to help your framing and image composition (safe frames, thirds, fibonnacci, isometric perspective\u2026) Parent accross comps is a simple way to parent a layer to another one in a parent composition, or in a precomposition, using locators and expressions. 2D Camera : new controls for predefined behaviours. Easily simulate a shoulder mount, a camera hold by hand, or on a tripod, with shake controls. Re-implemented the translation framework, and added French translation. It is now possible to add new translations to Duik. More details about this will be available on the wiki soon. Re-implemented Export to Audition from Duik 15. Export to Audition now transfers audio levels keyframes too! Improvements Wiggle : you can now control the complexity of the wiggle (octaves and mutliplier) and manually set a Random Seed to keep the same wiggle accross layers. UX/UI tweaks and improvements, stability improved. Fixes Effector set to infinite line is no longer reversed. Changing colors of controllers with Duik no longer freezes Duik. Locking In and Out ease in the animation panel now automatically adjust values according to the latest modification (on In or Out ease). Fixed the bad issue where sometimes the After Effects dialog windows would freeze Duik (and all the other scripts), and then display the \u201cCan not run a script while a modal dialog is waiting for response\u201d error when trying to launch any script again (based on an idea by Lars Jandel ). 16.0.0-Alpha-9 New Walk Cycle : the first procedural animation is available. The keyframe types button in the Animation panel can now be used to create keyframes on all animated properties. Extract controllers automatically from a precomp to your main composition, and animate outside of the precomposed character. Scale, flip, flop the character as you need. With After Effects > 15.1, extracted controllers can use Master Properties to be able to animate several instances of the same rig, in the same project. The Auto-rig is now smart enough to detect what you need if you\u2019re applying it to something else than predefined Structures . The IK and FK buttons have been removed from the Rookie UI mode, and moved into the Auto-rig options in the Standard and Expert modes. A new automation, the Looper allows to add both a loopIn and a loopOut on several properties at once, and control them with an animatable effect. The loops can be of the standard three types: \u201cCycle\u201d, \u201cOffset, \u201cPing Pong\u201d, and \u201cContinue\u201d. The Effector now has two modes: Circle or Infinite line . You can now import your traditionnal animations from Krita , just export them as CSV! Improvements Huge performance improvement. A lot of work have been made to make Duik run faster (especially the Structure creation and Autorig). Structures , Bones , and Controllers are now created with their quality set to \u201cDraft\u201d to improve performance in After Effects. FK Overlap now has individual controls for layers. FK Overlap option to (not)inherit the rotation of the parent layer. FK Overlap over IK. When an IK is created, the checkbox to deactivate IK activates individual FK controls as well as a Follow-Through & Overlap control. Added a checkbox to show/hide handles for the curvation of Bezier IK . They are now hidden by default. Added an individual control for the toes rotation in the Foot roll Add Bones is smarter: it will search for properties (with a priority for puppet pins) if there are no property selected. Add Bones adds nice effects when used on shapes, to allow the deletion of unneeded control layers afterwards. You can use an Orientation Constraint to create what was called the IK Goal in Duik 15, with much more possibilities. You can now link dimensions when using the Random tool on values. The data displayed in the IK effects is improved. The IK length is now computed in FK too, to be able to use it with the connector more reliably than using the Structure rotation. The Connector now automatically populates the \u201cmin\u201d and \u201cmax\u201d values based on the actual animation of the master property. A lot UI adjustments and improvements Fixes FK Overlap now working correctly with a parent. Bezier IK curve controller now created at a correct size, depending on the settings of the controllers. Walk Cycle now works better when there\u2019s no layer selected. The Auto-Rig for legs with foot roll now works when the structures have been rotated before running the Auto-Rig . The Search and Replace tool has been fixed. 16.0.0-Alpha-8 New Rookie Mode : An easy-to-use interface for beginners. Note: Duik will automatically switch to this mode on first start, go to the settings to set it again to standard or expert mode. Animation: IK/FK Snap and switch. Improvements IK (2 and 3 layers): rotation values are improved to prevent a \u201cjump\u201d in some cases. The rotation value on the upper part of the limb will now have a 360\u00b0 jump in the opposite direction than its orientation when the IK is created. IK (2 and 3 layers): the \u201creverse\u201d option in the effec of the controller have been moved unearthed to be more accessible. Structures : Use Alt+Click to assign a random color on creation. Bones : Use Alt+Click to assign a random color on creation. Bones : Use Ctrl+Click to create bones for vertices only, and not tangents (Quicker in case the shape does not use tangents). UI Tweaks. Lots of invisible tweaks. Some performance improvements (especially with some expressions in the Structures). Fixes List : no more error when applying on a spatial property (but spatial tangents will be lost) FK Overlap now works better even when the root has a parent. 16.0.0-Alpha-7 New FK Overlap tool, very useful for tails and ropes (or even arms)! 16.0.0-Alpha-6 New Re-implemented tools from Duik15: Camera Rig , Scale Z-Link , Import TVPaint Camera The Auto-rig now rigs tails. The Auto-rig now rigs digitigrades (cats and dogs\u2026). The Auto-rig now rigs ungulates (cattle, sheeps\u2026). Improvements Controllers scale locked on creation Controllers new shapes available Controllers : Slider , 2D Slider and Angle controllers now split in two layers: the actual control and a background. No more need to double click to animate them. Randomize UI updated to new UI style Expert Mode UI improvements Structures rotation and scale are now reset to 0 and 100% before applying IK/autorig Fixes Bezier IK not selecting the controller at the end of the creation. Bezier IK handles now working even when guides are hidden Orientation Constraint now working even if the constrained layer has a parent. 16.0.0-Alpha-5 New WonderUnit Storyboarder file import Implemented 2D Camera (renamed the 2D Multiplane from Duik 15) 2D Camera: Ability to add a layer (just duplicate any existing layer) Implemented the Autorig (legs, arms, spine but not tails or custom structures/layers yet) Improvements User Interface has been polished | The Expert mode might still have some issues which will be fixed later Layers created by Duik are now tagged with a marker. The marker can be renamed by the user, but cannot be removed: some data is stored internally to help Duik identify the layers and compute stuff. Fixes Bezier IK the \u201ccurve\u201d controller is now a position controller. Removed the Attachment Constraint which did not work as expected. Use the other constraints instead. 16.0.0-Alpha-4 Prepared Wonder Unit Storyboarder file import. 16.0.0-Alpha-3 New Animation Kleaner to clean the keyframes. Includes the Smart interpolations and Spatial Interpolations tools from previous Alpha versions. Connector able to connect to \u201cfake\u201d layer sequences using layer opacities (very powerful tool) Improvements UX: (clicking on the tab buttons sets the default panel - closes the current tool - for the tab) Connector UX/UI small improvements UI: Improved animation panel (separated keyframe tools and animation tools) Better naming conventions for controllers, bones, structures\u2026 Fixes Effector now works when re-using an existing controller layer. Randomize for properties and keyframes Connector when connecting a parent with an expression. Connector when connecting shapes and other unusual properties. IK when the root has a parent Bones on shapes with CC2018 16.0.0-Alpha-2 New Keyframe selection tool (in the animation tab) to easily batch select keyframes by type or by layers. Re-implemented tools from Duik 15: Rename , Search and replace , Measure .

(replace XX by any version name) Duik Bassel Duik Bassel has been tested and works on all versions since CS6. That means CS6, CC, CC2014, CC2015, CC2017 and CC2018 support Duik. We do not test Duik on versions older than CS6, so it may or may not work properly, we don\u2019t know!) But you can test it yourself, it won\u2019t break anything! Warning Duik Bassel does work on CS6, but the UI has a lot of issues we can not fix (they are issues in After Effects itself). Note Although Duik works well on older versions of After effects, some features may be deactivated, like some tools working with B\u00e9zier paths only on CC2018 and newer. Previous versions of Duik and After Effects If you need older versions of Duik which work with earlier versions of After Effects, you can get them there: https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF_Duik/tree/master/Release/Duik Duik 15.52 works with CS4 and all more recent versions. Duik 10 \u201coldafter\u201d even works with After Effects 7.0! Note Duik 15.52 can not be installed on the first After Effects v16.0 (CC2019) because of the missing PresetEffects.xml file. This is fixed in After Effects 16.1 and more recent versions. Can I keep (or safely remove) the older versions of Duik (15)? Duik Bassel can be installed along with Duik 15 or any other older version, it will not replace them, and you can continue to use both without any issue. However, if you don\u2019t need Duik 15 anymore, you can safely remove it: just delete all files with \u201cduik\u201d in their names in the ScriptUI Panels folder of After Effects, except Duik Bassel.jsx which is the only one needed by Duik Bassel. What is this ffmpeg file provided with Duik Bassel? ffmpeg is another free software for decoding, encoding and transcoding media files. It is needed by Duik Bassel for some specific features, especially the Export to Audition function which is able to transcode audio files, thanks to ffmpeg. After Effects shows an expression error saying Unterminated string constant when renaming layers or puppet pins. This is a known issue when using After Effects versions older than CC2017 on Mac OSX Sierra or more recent. If you rename elements using the Rename tool of Duik it should work correctly. This has been fixed in After Effects CC2017. Duik\u2019s user interface does not display correctly (it\u2019s cropped), I can\u2019t see all of it, what should I do? This is a bug in After Effects CC and CC2014 with windows and HiDPI screens (bigger than FullHD, 1920*1080), Duik can not do anything about it. There are three workarounds: Set the scaling of the display to 100% in the Microsoft Windows settings. Run Duik from the menu \u201cFile/Scripts/Run script\u2026\u201d in After Effects, instead of the \u201cWindows\u201d menu. But in this case, Duik won\u2019t be dockable. Update After Effects It seems I have missing buttons and tools in Duik, compared to what I can see in tutorials, screenshots, etc. Where are they? Duik Bassel has three user interface modes, and the default one, the Rookie mode does not include the most advanced tools; it is designed to be easy-to-use but powerful enough to rig and animate any kind of characters. If you\u2019re a beginner with Duik, you should not need the most advanced tools. To change the mode of the user interface and switch to Normal or Expert mode, go to the settings panel. When using some tools, this alert is shown: Internal Verification Failure: Unexpected match name searched for in group\" ( 29::0 ) , what can I do? This is a bug in After Effects CC2014 and CC2014.1, it is not an issue from Duik. Update After Effects to CC2014.2, or upgrade to a newer version. Duik worked well, but it won\u2019t start anymore. What can I do? Sometimes, the files Duik needs to run smoothly get corrupted, especially (but not only) on Mac OS. If this is the case, Duik may not even be able to start anymore, or may be showing a script alert at start. In this case, follow the procedure described here to re-initialize it. Changes between Duik Bassel, Duik 15 and older versions Duik 15 came with an installer, Duik Bassel is just a zip, why? Duik Bassel is so simple to install, it does not need an installer any more. Read the installation instructions . The Duik 15 installer included Dugr too, where can I find it now? Dugr is available on the Rainbox website . Where is the Rotation Morph ? The Rotation Morph is replaced by the new Connector which is able to do exactly the same stuff, plus many more. Where is the Orient to path tool? This tool has been removed as you can achieve the same thing natively in After Effects, in the \u201cGeometry/orientation\u201d options of the layers. Where is the IK Goal ? The IK Goal is replaced by the new Orientation Constraint which is able to do exactly the same stuff, plus many more. To create what was the IK Goal , simply add an empty orientation constraint to the layer. To connect its rotation to a controller like what the IK Goal did when you had a controller selected, modify the constraint on the layer to constrain it to the controller you want. Where is the hand goal checkbox? This checkbox was removed, as the \u201cEnable IK\u201d option in the effect of the IK is already connected to the \u201cgoal\u201d behaviour of the hand. After a lot of tests, we came to the conclusion that the goal was needed only in IK and not needed in FK, so the easier way to (de)activate it was to link it to the IK button too. Anyway, if you need to disable it but keep the IK active, you just have to add a Null object onto the end of the structure and link it to the forearm. Then, link the hand to this null object. To control the rotation with the controller, you can also add an small expression in the null\u2019s rotation: value + pickWhipToTheControllerRotation Rigging How can I scale a rigged character in Duik Bassel? It is not possible to scale the rig itself yet without adjusting some expressions, but : We\u2019re still working on this, and still have hope that in a future version of Duik you\u2019ll just have to scale the controllers. With the new \u201cExtract Controllers\u201d feature, you can already scale a rigged character: Add the rigged comp into another comp. Select the precomposition layer and, in the controllers panel of Duik, click on \u201cExtract controllers\u201d You can then animate from outside of the precomp, with the extracted controllers, AND you can scale the precomposition layer to scale the rig (the controllers will follow). We think this is a good workaround, you just have to take care of the resolution as it\u2019s a precomposition (and rasterization may not work properly with the rig), scaling up will damage it a bit, but scaling it down is ok. How can I use the connector to connect a single slave property to multiple master properties? As most of the tools in Duik, the connector uses expressions to connect the properties, and multiple expressions can not be easily combined into a single property. But there are work arounds! Read this section of the connector documentation to learn how to achieve this. What can I do to make Duik work better with imported vector layers (Illustrator, SVG, Flash\u2026) with continuous rasterization activated? After Effects\u2019 puppet tool (and Duik bones) is a pixel tool, but using continuous rasterization is using vector layers, so this raises some issues which are difficult to work around. IK have to work with coordinates of the layers, and continuous rasterization may mess up those coordinates too\u2026 However, the best you can do is converting those illustrator layers into shape layers (right click on the layer), which work better with the puppet tool and Duik. You can just precompose those layers too, while scaling them up in the precomposition to keep the quality of vectors. How can I create a \u201cLook At\u201d effect? What is called Look At in some 3D software and older versions of Duik is basically IK controlling an single element (Duik calls this a one-layer IK). To add a Look At on a layer with Duik, first select the target, then the layer, and click on the Autorig & IK button in the Links & Constraints panel. This will create IK on the layer, and a controller to use as a target. You can then adjust the parenting if you wish, especially parenting the target layer to the controller. Animation When applying the walk cycle, the controllers of the hands seem to be deactivated, why\u2019s that? The procedural walk cycle animates the arms with Forward Kinematics (FK) and thus deactivates the Inverse Kinematics (IK). They do not need to translate anymore as the animation is on the angles of the individual FK controls. If you want to animate/adjust the arms, you can either adjust the values in the Individual FK controls in the effects of the controllers, or you can re-enable the IK, but this will deactivate the procedural animation on the arms. Note You can animate the switch between IK and FK, and Duik provides a tool to ease this IK/FK switch process.","title":"F.A.Q."},{"location":"duik-faq.html#frequently-asked-questions","text":"If you don\u2019t find the answer to your question here, come and ask for help on the official forum or on Discord !

Take a look at the frequently asked questions if you don\u2019t find a solution to your issue in this user guide. If you\u2019re still stuck, come and ask for help on the official forum or on our live chat server ! How Duik works Duik is a script, this means all it does is automating things. It does nothing you could not do by yourself in After Effects (if you had time to do some very tedious work). This has two important meanings: A project rigged or animated with Duik can be opened with any installation of After Effects even if Duik is not installed. Duik uses only tools and techniques already existing in After Effects. Note This is not 100% true as the latest versions of Duik include ffmpeg , a free media encoder, used to transcode audio when exporting to Audition. In the future, it is possible that Duik include more third-party tools like that for specific features. The User Interface of Duik The goal of a tool like Duik is to make the life of animators (and riggers) easier. The priority was to make Duik as easy to learn as possible , while keeping it very quick to use . The other important goal was to make the interface as small as possible, so it won\u2019t take much place in the After Effects interface; we think it\u2019s very important to be able to focus on the timeline and the viewport of the application, without any other tools interfering when you\u2019re animating. To achieve this, we\u2019ve made Duik smarter. Almost all tools can be used in a single click , without any configuration step before, letting Duik make the best choice depending on what you\u2019re doing, what are the selected layers, etc. Most of the rigging process can be reduced to two clicks in Duik Bassel! First click: create a complete humano\u00efd Structure. Second click: Auto-rig the whole Structure. And this is done without any configuration step or other click in Duik. If you feel this is not enough, a nice procedural walk cycle is just another click away\u2026 User Interface (UI) As any modern script in After Effects, Duik has the form of a panel which can be docked with other native After Effects panels and third party tools (provided it was correctly installed and launched from the \u201cWindow\u201d menu of After Effects). The User Interface has been designed with these main ideas: Keep it close to the form of the user interface of After Effects Using controls similar to the native controls of After Effects helps the user get started quickier. But it was not possible, for specific features and for performance and stability reasons, to make everything exactly the same as in After Effects and controls differ a bit. The idea is that Duik must not stand out too much when docked with other After Effects panels. Do not use popups, windows and dialogs With very rare exceptions, everything Duik needs to display will be displayed in its main panel (with the exception of the Help Panel, which needs to be visible at any time), it won\u2019t use dialogs and other windows, so you know where to find informations, and you\u2019re not distracted by popups. Also, there are no blocking windows (what\u2019s called \u201cModal Dialogs\u201d), to keep an agile workflow. Keep the UI as small as possible What is important when working with graphics is the viewport. Duik is as small as it can be so it won\u2019t interfere with your workspace. Categorization Duik is a comprehensive tool set for rigging and animation. This means there are a lot of tools available, but they are categorized in some useful panels, depending on what you\u2019re doing (animating, rigging, using cameras\u2026) When launched, Duik displays a welcome screen showing these categories. Tip This welcome screen can be de-activated to get to the latest used panel as soon as Duik is launched, but this greatly increases its launch time. Later, these categories are always available on the top bar. Each panel can be displayed by clicking on one of these top buttons. The first button, on the left, opens a very simple yet useful notes editor . The other buttons display the available panels: Rigging Animation Camera Import and Export tools On the bottom bar, you\u2019ll find some other useful buttons: The RX icon opens the Rainbox Lab. website where you can find useful information about Duik and other tools. You can also read the version of Duik you\u2019re using, and the two buttons at the right open two other panels: Settings Help Individual panels As Duik is made of a lot of panels and sub-panels, depending on your workflow, sometimes you may lose time constantly switching from one panel to another, or just finding a tool you\u2019re not used to. As there are as many workflows as users, to address this issue Duik now comes with a lot of optionnal, individual and dockable panels , which you can use as stand-alone scripts. This is a great way to organize your workspace and keep several different panels of Duik opened at once. When these stand-alone panels are installed, you can also quickly open them by [Alt] + Click on the tab buttons in the Duik Bassel main panel. Tip Don\u2019t forget the stacked mode for After Effects panels, which can be nice to keep all your Duik panels at hand. Among these individual panels, you\u2019ll also find a special one, the Duik Cmd panel\u2026 User Experience (UX) For every feature in Duik, the goal is to have a consistent workflow, the fastest possible, the easiest possible. Most of the tools work this way: Select layers, properties or keyframes in the timeline of After Effects a. Click on the button of the tool you need b. For some tools, a secondary panel is displayed to ask some other needed information Watch Duik work (Actually, you won\u2019t, as for performance reasons most of the work remains hidden from the user, sorry ;) ) To be able to work in a single click, the tools need to be smart enough to take some decisions depending on what you\u2019re doing. Of course, Duik does not want you to be or feel limited to what you can do. Although most of the tools work in a single click, some of them are accompanied with a little \u201ccircle\u201d button. This means there are options you can change for the future use of the tool, which you can access by clicking on the circle. Duik can also be personalized through some settings so you can adapt it to your tastes, even if you have very bad tastes. Rookie, standard or expert mode As Duik includes a lot of tools, it has been decided to filter them and adapt the user interface depending on the level of the user, to make it easier for beginners, while quicker and more complete to the most advanced users. There are three different modes for the user interface, depending on your level: Rookie is the simplest one, recommended if this is the first time you use Duik Bassel. Only the most used and simplest tools are available, and the user interface is thought to be as easy to use as possible. Standard has all the tools available, in a nice and easy-to-use user interface. Expert is the smallest mode, and may be a bit more complex to use as there are less texts to explain what do the buttons do. What Duik does in After Effects The After Effects features mainly used by Duik are: Expressions Layers creation Custom effect Expressions (Almost) Every time Duik adds an expression, the expression begins with a comment to let you know what the expression is and does. Layers Although Duik uses existing layer types in After Effects (mostly shape layers and null objects), the layers it creates have a specific use and can be considered as new layer types. Layers created by Duik have a marker at their beginning, showing how Duik uses them (their \u201cDuik Type\u201d), and containing important data that Duik needs to work with them. Do not remove these markers (but you can move them away, even before the beginning of the comp to hide them, if you find them annoying). The types defined by Duik are: Controllers can be shape layers or null objects (depending on a setting in the controller editor panel). They are used to manipulate and animate compositions rigged by Duik. Structures are shape layers used to actually rig characters and props. They should not be manipulated by the animator and can be hidden as soon as the rigging process is finished. Bones are shape layers which control spatial properties of effects or bezier shapes and masks. They are usually parented to Structures to be rigged and animated, but sometimes can be animated themselves just to control the position of an effect, or parent it to anything else. Locators are null objects used to expose the absolute transformations of another layer in a composition, and to create links between layers and compositions. (Spatial) Effectors are a special type of controllers used to drive properties and motion depending on spatial coordinates. There are other types of layers used by Duik, which are more specific to some tools. Custom effects Duik uses a lot of custom effects, which are more generally called Pseudo-Effects in the After Effects community, although this is not an official feature in After Effects. Pseudo-Effects are a hack to create nicer controls for expressions than the native After Effects \u201cExpression controls\u201d effects, but they do nothing more than controlling expressions too. It\u2019s a bit complicated to create them by hand in After Effects, but there are useful scripts which do this very easily like Pseudo Effect Maker . Duik makes a great use of them to create nice user-friendly controls in the effects of the controllers. Always have a look in the Effect panel of After Effects when you rig something with Duik! Removing Duik \u201ceffects\u201d When you need to remove something made by Duik, you have to understand that Duik did nothing more than creating layers, expressions and pseudo-effects. Each time you need to remove something, you just have to remove the expressions and pseudo effects created by Duik, and maybe the layers too. This can sometimes be a bit tedious, but future versions of Duik will include tools to automate this process.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"first-look-at-duik.html#first-look","text":"","title":"First Look"},{"location":"first-look-at-duik.html#help","text":"If you need help, click on the bottom right button in Duik to open the contextual help , or hold the [Shift] button on your keyboard while clicking on any button to get some help .

Standard has all the tools available, in a nice and easy-to-use user interface. Expert is the smallest mode, and may be a bit more complex to use as there are less texts to explain what do the buttons do.","title":"Rookie, standard or expert mode"},{"location":"first-look-at-duik.html#what-duik-does-in-after-effects","text":"The After Effects features mainly used by Duik are: Expressions Layers creation Custom effect","title":"What Duik does in After Effects"},{"location":"first-look-at-duik.html#expressions","text":"(Almost) Every time Duik adds an expression, the expression begins with a comment to let you know what the expression is and does.","title":"Expressions"},{"location":"first-look-at-duik.html#layers","text":"Although Duik uses existing layer types in After Effects (mostly shape layers and null objects), the layers it creates have a specific use and can be considered as new layer types. Layers created by Duik have a marker at their beginning, showing how Duik uses them (their \u201cDuik Type\u201d), and containing important data that Duik needs to work with them. Do not remove these markers (but you can move them away, even before the beginning of the comp to hide them, if you find them annoying). The types defined by Duik are: Controllers can be shape layers or null objects (depending on a setting in the controller editor panel). They are used to manipulate and animate compositions rigged by Duik. Structures are shape layers used to actually rig characters and props. They should not be manipulated by the animator and can be hidden as soon as the rigging process is finished. Bones are shape layers which control spatial properties of effects or bezier shapes and masks. They are usually parented to Structures to be rigged and animated, but sometimes can be animated themselves just to control the position of an effect, or parent it to anything else. Locators are null objects used to expose the absolute transformations of another layer in a composition, and to create links between layers and compositions. (Spatial) Effectors are a special type of controllers used to drive properties and motion depending on spatial coordinates. There are other types of layers used by Duik, which are more specific to some tools.","title":"Layers"},{"location":"first-look-at-duik.html#custom-effects","text":"Duik uses a lot of custom effects, which are more generally called Pseudo-Effects in the After Effects community, although this is not an official feature in After Effects.

It\u2019s a bit complicated to create them by hand in After Effects, but there are useful scripts which do this very easily like Pseudo Effect Maker .

Options You can select keyframes at a specific time or in a time range. The time can be the time of the playhead or a specific time, and the time range can be either the work area or a specific range. To set specific time and time range, you can click on the eyedropper to pick the current values from the playhead or the work area. You can use the filters to select the keyframes of a specific type or on specific layers only. Interpolations Just under the \u2018Select keyframes\u2019 button, there are several tools to quickly adjust the interpolations of the selected keyframes. The first line of buttons can be used to change the interpolation type of the keyframes, or add keyframes of the wanted type on the properties. With the first button on the left, you can switch between the \u2018Edit\u2019 mode and the \u2018Add key\u2019 mode. In Standard Mode (only), you can manage some interpolation presets, which store and reset velocity and ease. The two sliders and the percentage adjust the ease on the selected keyframes, while the value just below defines the velocity. Kleaner The Kleaner is a tool to automatically clean the selected animations. It is able to remove unneeded keyframes, clean the interpolations, etc. Description It works both on spatial interpolations and keyframe eases, in three default steps: Fix spatial interpolation: the Kleaner will detect spatial tangents which should not be there, for example when two successive keyframes are exactly at the same place but with tangents between them. Smooth temporal interpolations. The Kleaner will adjust the animation curves to make them as smooth as possible, automatically detecting the best velocities and eases. It works a bit like the Auto-Bezier feature in After Effects but\u2026 better. The Kleaner will remove all unnecessary keyframes, keeping the exact same animation but with less keys. Use Select the keyframes of the animation you want to clean. Click on the Kleaner button. Additional Panel The additional panel is divided in three sections corresponding to the three steps of the \u201cKleaner \u201d process. Spatial Interpolations: The four leftmost buttons can be used to quickly change the tangents of several spatial keyframes at once. Check or uncheck the checkbox to activate or deactivate this step when you run the Kleaner Temporal interpolation smoothing: Use the two leftmost buttons to tell the Kleaner if the first and last keyframes of the animation have to be linear or with ease.

Use By default, the Copy and Paste tools will work exactly like the default copying and pasting in After Effects (except it works on several layers at once). If, when pasting, Duik can not find any corresponding layer to paste some properties, you will be prompted to choose (or ignore) the layers yourself. The dialog will show the names of the missing layers along with some selectors to set the layers where to paste the animations.

This means its priority is image quality against performance. But it includes a lot of tools which work really well to build cut-out animation, and even vector animation, like parenting, the puppet tool and especially expressions. And After Effects is very good at manipulating pixel assets (better than vectors), which makes it also a decent software for cut-out character animation. These last few years, a lot of third-party tools were built on top of these features, specifically made for character animation; Duik was the first in 2008, followed by others ( Rubberhose , Joystick and Sliders , etc.). Before that, there was no real character rigging, and it was fine. But it brought high-level rigging and animation to After Effects, and very nice films were made with this technique. It also brought a lot of performance issues. Remember? After Effects was meant to do compositing, not character animation. In this section, we\u2019re going to see how to improve the performance of rigged characters in After Effects and with Duik. Tip Most of these explanations are valid for other scripts too, as they\u2019re all built on top of After Effects features. On the contrary, this is not always true for plugins which add new features to After Effects instead of automating the use of existing features. Choose the right tool Honnestly, if you\u2019re in some kind of very advanced rigging and animation, if you\u2019re in top-level quality and need both performance and versatility, After Effects may not be the right choice. Did you know South Park was made with Maya ? Why don\u2019t you animate in Blender with a nice rig? You can rig 2D characters in 3D softwares, and you won\u2019t have performance issues there. But we agree that sometimes, it\u2019s easier and quickier to use less softwares, to not have to render animations between different softwares and to animate in the same software which will be used for compositing. In this case, Duik is the tool you need for character animation in After Effects. Know the culprits Some tools are more compute-intensive than others. You have to know which one to avoid or to optimize to fix performance issues in your rigs. You must know that Duik only uses native After Effects features, it automates things you could do by yourself (provided you have a lot of time to spend at it). This means it is not Duik by itself which causes performance issues, it is how native After Effects features are used together and how many of them at the same time. This is a non-exhaustive list of features you have to be careful with. They are ordered by priority on your performance improvement process. Note Some explanations here might not be perfectly accurate about how After Effects works (there are caching systems and other tricks to improve performance we won\u2019t explain here), but the point is to explain where to look at to improve performance. Preview quantity and quality This is not what will improve performance the most, but it\u2019s measures you can take without making any compromise on the features of your rig. When animating, you can downgrade the quality of the preview, and the quantity of layers displayed. Do you really need to display the Structures ? Do Structures and Controllers really need anti-aliasing, or could they be set to draft mode ? Actually, do controllers need to be shape layers or could they be simple nulls? Do all layers have to be vectors or could they be pre-rendered to an image format? These are the kind of questions you have to ask yourself. There are a few options to speed up the preview and your workflow in After Effects. You can set the overall quality of the preview. The default option, Adaptive Resolution , does not seem to be the best choice, as constantly changing the resolution of the preview when moving layers does not feel fluid at all. Off (Final Quality) does feel way more fluid when working, as does Fast Draft . We don\u2019t actually see much difference between Fast Draft and Off (Final Quality) \u2026 You can change the resolution of the preview. Again, the default one, Auto may not be the best for fluidity if you have this habit a lot of people have to constantly zoom in and out, to work details and have an overall look at the image, and if you don\u2019t always do RAM previews at the same level of zoom. In this case, After Effects will be constantly rendering the preview at different resolutions and this has a very bad impact on performance and fluidity. It may be best to wisely choose a resolution and stick to it. Most of the time, when animating in HD or 2K compositions (or bigger), Half resolution or even Third is enough. You can change the quality of the preview per layer too. In the attributes of the layer, clicking this icon will disable anti-aliasing and other algorithms which are not needed for animation, and this will greatly improve performance. Do the controllers really need the best quality? The quantity of layers enabled greatly impacts performance. Solo the layers as much as possible, hide anything not needed. For this workflow, our other free tool Dugr can be a great help, and it is fully compatible with Duik. Shapes vs images Every time you use a bezier shape, After Effects has to rasterize it before it can display it and render the composition. This means the more shape layers you have, the lower the performance will be. Every time it is possible, you should precompose the shape layer, to the smallest composition you can: this way the precomposition is an image layer, with actual pixels, and faster to render. You can even render the precomposition to an image sequence to replace it or use as a proxy. Proxies are great! Tip A shape layer without animation nor expressions in its content should always be replaced by an image. Especially when using the puppet tool! As it works in pixels and not with the vector data, you won\u2019t lose quality, there\u2019s no need to keep the vectors. And precomposing the shape will fix a lot of issues\u2026 It is NOT a good idea to use shapes hoping to be able to scale them . It will have a bad impact on performance, scaling is another step in the render process which takes some time. Especially if you have a lot of shape layers. Scaling rigs is very complicated as it will probably break a lot of expressions. Before working your animation, you should always draw a storyboard; this way you know which scales are needed for your character and you can build a different rig for each. When you see only a close up on the torso and the head, do you really need the rig of the legs? When the character is far away, do you really need complex facial expressions? Will you even draw the character the same way? If you\u2019re using vectors only for scaling purposes, you can rasterize them and greatly improve performance. Precompositions Precompositions are an under-estimated way to improve performance. Each time you duplicate a layer, you have to ask yourself if you can precompose it first in any way and then duplicate the precomposition. Very often, you can precompose! Hint Keep in mind that you can use expressions to link stuff from the precomposition to the main composition. With the Parent accross compositions tool of Duik, you can even parent a layer in a precomposition to a layer outside of it. The Extract Controllers tool can be of great help too. When you precompose before duplicating the layer(s), all its transformation and effects will be rendered only once and only then they will be duplicated. Without precomposition, everything has to be rendered twice (or more if you duplicate again the same layer). Image Formats Not all formats are equal. If you\u2019ve understood what we wrote just above, you may be beginning to use more image formats and less shapes, whether it\u2019s for proxies or final render. What formats should we use? When rendering animations, most of the time it\u2019s better to use image sequences than video files. There is at least one very good and simple reason for it: if the render fails, you won\u2019t have to start it all again, but just the remaining frames. If you want to change something in the animation, you will only have to render the corresponding frames. You should use a format which suits your needs (color depth, alpha channel), but also a format which is fast to read and write by After Effects! Our advice is to use OpenEXR (with PIZ compression): it\u2019s lossless , it handles 32bpc , and has an alpha channel . It is also way faster to read/write than PNG in After Effects, and files are usually smaller with EXR. It\u2019s better than the RAW format of your camera, it\u2019s great for storing HDRi. Premiere and other editting software, as well as Photoshop, can read them; as specified in the name, they\u2019re open and widely compatible. What more could one ask for? Puppet tool The puppet tool, as awesome as it is, especially with the new engine from latest versions, is very often a source of great performance issues. You won\u2019t notice it on a single layer, but when your rig is finished and you have a lot of layers using the puppet tool, or several characters together, you might be very annoyed by performance issues. Before using the puppet tool, always ask yourself if you could do the same stuff with simple tools. Very often, you could just animate the Bezier paths of vector characters instead of using the puppet tool. Example When rigging an arm made of vectors, you could first animate the arm bending, keyframing the Bezier paths properties instead of using the puppet tool. Then, you can connect this animation to the rotation of the Structure of the forearm using Duik\u2019s Connector . A nice side effect is that you have a lot more control on the shape of the arm when it bends. Expressions Expressions in After Effects are all evaluated (computed) when rendering each frame of the composition . This won\u2019t be an issue if they are simple, with basic calculations like the vast majority of expressions you may write by yourself. Now, imagine an expression, which, when it is evaluated (i.e. at each frame of the composition), needs to compute previous movements of some other layers - this is what simulations do. This means it also needs to compute everything which influences the layers in previous frames of the composition, including other expressions, which might be complex too\u2026 This is a nasty situation where performance will drop dramatically. You\u2019ll have to take care of what needs to be computed, and what the hierarchy of the expressions and layers is. Some features of Duik use very complex expressions , and compute-intensive calculations, like the IK which involves more maths than simple additions and multiplications, or simulated automations like the spring which have to compute previous movements. Even if we\u2019ve been hard at work to fix performance issues, in some cases combining a lot of expressions (i.e. Duik features) can lead to poorer performance when animating, or even so much lag that the rig cannot be correctly manipulated anymore. Note Don\u2019t worry about simple expressions you create manually, like links between properties, or simple wiggles, etc. They\u2019re not a problem, even if you have hundreds of them. When talking about complex expressions, just remember that the more expressions = the more performance issues you\u2019ll have. Performance and Duik Duik includes some options to help you adjust the performance of your rigs. Controllers In the additionnal panel of the controllers, there are three options to change the way they are displayed which have an impact on performance: You can bake their appearance , which will remove all controls and expressions used to adjust how they are displayed, but are not needed by the rig itself. It is strongly advised to do this every time you finish a rig, when everything is ready to be animated. Tip As the controllers are standard shape layers, you will still be able to adjust their appearance by editting the content of the shape layers anyway. You can choose between Draft or Best Quality mode for drawing the shapes of the controllers (with or without anti-aliasing). Note This sets the layer quality option of the controllers when they are created, and it can be changed afterwards at any time in After Effects. You can choose to use null layers instead of shape layers. This may be less user-friendly, but improves performance. Structures and bones As for the controllers, the additionnal panel of the Structures and the Bones provide a Bake appearance option to improve performance. Note The Auto-rig bakes the appearance of the Structures by default when it is run. There\u2019s an option to change this. Parent constraint Warning The parent constraint can be very heavy. The Parent constraint is a great tool but\u2026 It can be very computer-intensive. To be able to compute the location of a layer, it has to compute the previous movement of all it\u2019s parents on the previous frames of the composition. This means the longer the composition is, the slower it will be. Avoid using it in very long compositions, and try to use it only when necessary. Often, it is easier and quickier to just split the layer when its parent must change. IK The IK used in a character like the ones created by the Auto-rig will not be a problem unless you have a lot of them, but there are a few tips to make them even lighter. You can disable the guides on the controllers (the dashed lines representing the IK) in the effects of the controller. When you deactivate the IK and animate in FK, the performance is usually better, and FK animation is actually easier than IK . Automations Some automations are heavier than others. These are the ones you should be worried about: Spring (simulated) Caution Beware of the simulation. The default Spring automation should not be an issue most of the times. But beware of the simulated mode! As every simulations, it involves a lot more computation and can quickly become a reason why your rig won\u2019t work anymore. Try to use as few as possible, and keep in mind that most of the time, animating hanging hairs or the antenna of a car is quick and easy with a few keyframes. Way quickier and easier than character animation. Wheel (curved motion) The default Wheel automation is very light won\u2019t be any problem. But be careful with the curve mode, as it needs to compute the trajectory of the wheel on all the previous frames of the composition. At the end of a long composition, this can be very heavy. Tip You should always cut/hide a layer with automations as soon as it is outside of the frame! Other automations The other automations are not particularly heavy. Just be careful with automations like the Effector which is often used to drive a lot of layers together, which means its a lot of expressions. Choose the right version of After Effects All versions of After Effects behave differently. Do not hesitate to test your rig on different versions and see where you feel it\u2019s better! From our tests, animating in CC (12) or CC2014 (13) is nicer , as the UI is more responsive and fluid. Of course, this is in case you don\u2019t need master properties or expressions to control Bezier paths (available since CC2018 (15)), but there are workarounds from using master properties, and expressions controlling Bezier paths are quite heavy and should be avoided when possible. When working with lots of effects, like when compositing, this is not true, and you may prefer a more recent version which will render the frames faster. In this case, the latest version is always the best.","title":"Performance"},{"location":"performance.html#a-note-about-performance","text":"Originally, After Effects is not meant to be an animation software, it is a compositing tool. This means its priority is image quality against performance. But it includes a lot of tools which work really well to build cut-out animation, and even vector animation, like parenting, the puppet tool and especially expressions. And After Effects is very good at manipulating pixel assets (better than vectors), which makes it also a decent software for cut-out character animation. These last few years, a lot of third-party tools were built on top of these features, specifically made for character animation; Duik was the first in 2008, followed by others ( Rubberhose , Joystick and Sliders , etc.). Before that, there was no real character rigging, and it was fine. But it brought high-level rigging and animation to After Effects, and very nice films were made with this technique. It also brought a lot of performance issues. Remember? After Effects was meant to do compositing, not character animation. In this section, we\u2019re going to see how to improve the performance of rigged characters in After Effects and with Duik. Tip Most of these explanations are valid for other scripts too, as they\u2019re all built on top of After Effects features. On the contrary, this is not always true for plugins which add new features to After Effects instead of automating the use of existing features.","title":"A note about performance"},{"location":"performance.html#choose-the-right-tool","text":"Honnestly, if you\u2019re in some kind of very advanced rigging and animation, if you\u2019re in top-level quality and need both performance and versatility, After Effects may not be the right choice. Did you know South Park was made with Maya ? Why don\u2019t you animate in Blender with a nice rig? You can rig 2D characters in 3D softwares, and you won\u2019t have performance issues there. But we agree that sometimes, it\u2019s easier and quickier to use less softwares, to not have to render animations between different softwares and to animate in the same software which will be used for compositing. In this case, Duik is the tool you need for character animation in After Effects.","title":"Choose the right tool"},{"location":"performance.html#know-the-culprits","text":"Some tools are more compute-intensive than others. You have to know which one to avoid or to optimize to fix performance issues in your rigs. You must know that Duik only uses native After Effects features, it automates things you could do by yourself (provided you have a lot of time to spend at it). This means it is not Duik by itself which causes performance issues, it is how native After Effects features are used together and how many of them at the same time. This is a non-exhaustive list of features you have to be careful with. They are ordered by priority on your performance improvement process. Note Some explanations here might not be perfectly accurate about how After Effects works (there are caching systems and other tricks to improve performance we won\u2019t explain here), but the point is to explain where to look at to improve performance.","title":"Know the culprits"},{"location":"performance.html#preview-quantity-and-quality","text":"This is not what will improve performance the most, but it\u2019s measures you can take without making any compromise on the features of your rig. When animating, you can downgrade the quality of the preview, and the quantity of layers displayed. Do you really need to display the Structures ? Do Structures and Controllers really need anti-aliasing, or could they be set to draft mode ? Actually, do controllers need to be shape layers or could they be simple nulls? Do all layers have to be vectors or could they be pre-rendered to an image format? These are the kind of questions you have to ask yourself. There are a few options to speed up the preview and your workflow in After Effects. You can set the overall quality of the preview. The default option, Adaptive Resolution , does not seem to be the best choice, as constantly changing the resolution of the preview when moving layers does not feel fluid at all. Off (Final Quality) does feel way more fluid when working, as does Fast Draft . We don\u2019t actually see much difference between Fast Draft and Off (Final Quality) \u2026 You can change the resolution of the preview. Again, the default one, Auto may not be the best for fluidity if you have this habit a lot of people have to constantly zoom in and out, to work details and have an overall look at the image, and if you don\u2019t always do RAM previews at the same level of zoom. In this case, After Effects will be constantly rendering the preview at different resolutions and this has a very bad impact on performance and fluidity. It may be best to wisely choose a resolution and stick to it. Most of the time, when animating in HD or 2K compositions (or bigger), Half resolution or even Third is enough. You can change the quality of the preview per layer too. In the attributes of the layer, clicking this icon will disable anti-aliasing and other algorithms which are not needed for animation, and this will greatly improve performance. Do the controllers really need the best quality? The quantity of layers enabled greatly impacts performance. Solo the layers as much as possible, hide anything not needed. For this workflow, our other free tool Dugr can be a great help, and it is fully compatible with Duik.","title":"Preview quantity and quality"},{"location":"performance.html#shapes-vs-images","text":"Every time you use a bezier shape, After Effects has to rasterize it before it can display it and render the composition. This means the more shape layers you have, the lower the performance will be. Every time it is possible, you should precompose the shape layer, to the smallest composition you can: this way the precomposition is an image layer, with actual pixels, and faster to render. You can even render the precomposition to an image sequence to replace it or use as a proxy. Proxies are great! Tip A shape layer without animation nor expressions in its content should always be replaced by an image. Especially when using the puppet tool! As it works in pixels and not with the vector data, you won\u2019t lose quality, there\u2019s no need to keep the vectors. And precomposing the shape will fix a lot of issues\u2026 It is NOT a good idea to use shapes hoping to be able to scale them . It will have a bad impact on performance, scaling is another step in the render process which takes some time. Especially if you have a lot of shape layers. Scaling rigs is very complicated as it will probably break a lot of expressions. Before working your animation, you should always draw a storyboard; this way you know which scales are needed for your character and you can build a different rig for each. When you see only a close up on the torso and the head, do you really need the rig of the legs? When the character is far away, do you really need complex facial expressions? Will you even draw the character the same way? If you\u2019re using vectors only for scaling purposes, you can rasterize them and greatly improve performance.","title":"Shapes vs images"},{"location":"performance.html#precompositions","text":"Precompositions are an under-estimated way to improve performance. Each time you duplicate a layer, you have to ask yourself if you can precompose it first in any way and then duplicate the precomposition. Very often, you can precompose! Hint Keep in mind that you can use expressions to link stuff from the precomposition to the main composition. With the Parent accross compositions tool of Duik, you can even parent a layer in a precomposition to a layer outside of it. The Extract Controllers tool can be of great help too. When you precompose before duplicating the layer(s), all its transformation and effects will be rendered only once and only then they will be duplicated. Without precomposition, everything has to be rendered twice (or more if you duplicate again the same layer).","title":"Precompositions"},{"location":"performance.html#image-formats","text":"Not all formats are equal. If you\u2019ve understood what we wrote just above, you may be beginning to use more image formats and less shapes, whether it\u2019s for proxies or final render. What formats should we use? When rendering animations, most of the time it\u2019s better to use image sequences than video files. There is at least one very good and simple reason for it: if the render fails, you won\u2019t have to start it all again, but just the remaining frames. If you want to change something in the animation, you will only have to render the corresponding frames. You should use a format which suits your needs (color depth, alpha channel), but also a format which is fast to read and write by After Effects! Our advice is to use OpenEXR (with PIZ compression): it\u2019s lossless , it handles 32bpc , and has an alpha channel . It is also way faster to read/write than PNG in After Effects, and files are usually smaller with EXR. It\u2019s better than the RAW format of your camera, it\u2019s great for storing HDRi.

The process can be summarized in just a few words: Structure a. Create Structures b. Link layers Controls a. Auto-rig b. Constraints Animation To get started quickly with this process, just watch this jumpstart by Jake In Motion : Structures Structures are layers you can add in your composition which will drive the animations, like the rig of a real puppet. The process is very simple: create or import your design in After Effects, add Structures and move them to the right spots (the pivots of each limb). Then you can rig those Structures, instead of the design itself like in previous versions of Duik, and finally link the design layers to the corresponding Structure layers. This way, the rig you create is independant from the design. This means it\u2019s easier to adjust the design even after the rig has been made, or even to re-use the same rig with other designs. Also, this rigging process is easier to fix or change if ever you need to adjust it even when you\u2019re already in the process of animation. Controllers Using the autorig, and a set of constraints, what you end with are controllers to drive the animation. You animate the controllers, they drive the structures through the constraints, and voil\u00e0! Your character moves. Constraints The interaction between the controllers and the Structures, and between the Structures themselves, happens through some constraints . Some of them are the core tools of Duik since the first version, like IK which drive the bending of limbs, and the Bones which are used to control any spatial properties: puppet pins, the emitter of a particle effect, and, with CC2018 and newer versions of After Effects, any bezier value, like shapes or masks. There is also a whole new set of constraints to automate even more movements and make the animator\u2019s life very easier: it\u2019s now possible to animate parenting with the new Parent Link constraint, or to constrain a layer to a bezier path, to attach a layer to other layers using weights, etc. Auto-rig Let\u2019s face it, most of the time you only need to rig standard animals, with legs, arms, spine, maybe a tail\u2026 All what differs are the hair, some props and cloth. The Auto-rig is a versatile tool to automate most of this process. It is able to recognize predefined Structures created by Duik and rig them automatically. It handles all kinds of limbs and animals, even imaginary ones. All you have to do is to create the Structures , the Auto-rig will do the rest, adding constraints and controllers for a fully rigged character. All that will be remaining are specific cases (hair, props), and facial rigging which is not automated yet . Automations As soon as your character is rigged, you can begin the animation, being helped by a lot of Automations . Automations are procedural animations and dynamics to quickly set the most common animations up and then focus on the characterization of your character. You can automate wiggles, springs, wheels, etc. with customizable and advanced controls for example to loop the effects, and access each and every detail quickly and easily.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"rigging.html#the-rigging-process-in-duik-bassel","text":"To make the rigging process easier and more versatile in After Effects, Duik Bassel introduces the Structures which are very similar to bones or joints in 3D softwares.

Select the properties Click on the \u201cSpring\u201d button The spring is computed depending on the velocity of the layer, whenever it stops.

Effect The elasticity controls both the amplitude and the frequency of the motion. A Higher elasticity will result in a higher frequency but lower amplitude. The damping controls how long it takes for the property to stop to move. If the spring is set on a spatial property, there are two ways to compute it: Basic: the computation is made with the keyframes of the property itself.

It\u2019s a very quick and simple way to get started with walk animations. A nice walk cycle is just a click away, but you can go into details and adjust the character height and weight, but also every individual limb parameter and precisely set how it walks\u2026 To use the walk cycle, you must have a rigged character. Hint In the Structures panel, [Alt + Click] on the \u201cHominoid\u201d button will create a complete biped with a demo walk cycle. Hint This walk cycle was made for bipeds, but you can achieve a quadruped walkcycle using two walk cycles: one for the front legs, shoulders, neck and head, and another one for the back legs and hips. You only have to animate the tail by yourself. To get started quickly with this process, just watch this jumpstart by Jake In Motion ! Setup Before creating the walk cycle, make sure the character is standing straight, with the arms along the body, in a natural pose. You will still be able to move the controllers after the walk cycle has been created to adjust the pose and the look of the walk, or even animate them above the automatic animation to adjust it. The walk cycle is not meant to create perfect and characteroized animation. It is a tool useful to get started quickly with walk animations which would need some tweaks to characterize them, or to animate quickly secondary, less important, characters. If the character was rigged by predefined limb Structures and the Auto-rig of Duik, using the walkcycle is pretty straightforward: Select all the controllers of the character Click on the \u201cWalk Cycle button\u201d If the character was rigged using custom Structures in Duik, or any other tool (Rubberhose, BAO Bones\u2026) or even custom expressions, you can also use the walk cycle, but you will have to make some easy connections: Select all the controllers of the character (the layers used to animate it, or which contain the effects needed to animate it) Open the additionnal panel for the Walk cycle Assign the layers to their corresponding limbs. The eyedropper will set the currently selected layer in the composition. a. Click on the \u201cCreate\u201d button b. Duik will try to link the properties of the controllers to the walk cycle, but if you are using custom rigs, it may not find them all, in this case, read the effect description below to see how you can connect them manually. The Walk Cycle can be adjusted in the effects of the walk cycle controller which has been created in the composition. Tip All controllers can still be animated, so you can add your own keyframes to adjust the animation to your taste or animate anything else. Feel free to move the controllers to adjust the pose of the character. Caution The procedural walk cycle animates the arms with Forward Kinematics (FK) and thus deactivates the Inverse Kinematics (IK). The position of the controllers of the armes do not influence the rig anymore, as the animation is made on the angles of the individual FK controls. If you want to animate or adjust the arms, you can either adjust the values in the Individual FK controls in the effects of the controllers, or you can re-enable the IK, but this will deactivate the procedural animation on the arms. Tip Duik tries to auto-detect which arm is the left arm and which is the right arm, but depending on the design, this detection may fail. In this case, both arms will swing synchroneously. You can fix this in the effects of the controllers for the arms, where you will find a \u201cside\u201d property to change the side of the arm. Hint You can animate the switch between IK and FK, and Duik provides a tool to ease this IK/FK switch process. Effect The \u201cGeneral motion\u201d value can be used to start and stop the walk cycle. You can then animate the character as you would without the walk cycle tool to continue the animation before or after the walk. The \u201cMain parameters\u201d set the general information needed by the walk cycle to animate it correctly The \u201csecondary controls\u201d are used to tweak each individual limb motion The \u201cAnimation data\u201d is where you can connect custom controllers to the walk cycle, get data to use in your own expressions and rigs, and adjust some parameters needed for the computation. Main Parameters All parameters use the metric system for now. Future versions of Duik will let you choose between the metric system and imperial units. \u201cCharacter\u201d: sets the main traits of the character. Its height influences the frequency of the cycle (the apparent speed of the feet). Its weight mainly influences the accelerations and decelerations of the motion (the momentum). The energy controls the amplitude of the movements. The softness controls how the muscles are contracted or not. \u201cWalk Cycle\u201d: sets the characteristics of the walk. The walk speed adjusts the speed of the character. This parameters changes the amplitude of the steps - it does not change the frequency of the cycle which depends on the height of the character. To change the direction of the cycle, change the sign of the speed. You can choose between to walk cycle types: realistic is the most natural, and dancing adds a \u201cdouble bounce\u201d like Mickey Mouse. Secondary controls Here you can adjust how each individual limb moves. In this version of Duik, you can not control separately the left and the right, but if you need to differenciate each side, you can create two different versions of the walk cycle in the same composition, one for each side. You can adjust the swinging amplitude the limbs, their softness (how the muscles are contracted), etc. Do not hesitate to test each control individually to see how it affects the walk cycle. Animation data In this section you can adjust how the walk cycle is computed, connect your custom rig and controllers which Duik could not connect automatically, or get useful data for your own rigs and expressions. Animation This is where you can connect the properties of custom rigs and controllers. Each value in this section outputs the animation of the corresponding property on each limb. To connect the properties of your controllers, use the expression pickwhip to pick the corresponding animation property, and add \u2018+ value;\u2019 at the end of the resulting expression. The arms animation uses FK, you need to connect them to angle properties. The feet animation uses IK, connect them to position properties. Parameters Duik tries to set some important parameters automatically when you create the walk cycle with some controllers selected, but if you are using a custom rig or if you connect controllers later, these properties may not be set properly. You can adjust them in this section. Duik needs to know the height of the legs of the character as displayed in the composition, in pixels, from the heel to the hips, when the character is standing. Duik also needs the height of the whole characer, in pixels, from the heel to the top of the head. Computation This section outputs some values used by Duik to compute the walk cycle. You can use them in your own expressions and rigs. One value is especially useful: the cycle duration, which is available in seconds or frames. To render perfect loops, you can set the work area or the composition duration to this value.","title":"Walk Cycle"},{"location":"walk-cycle.html#walk-cycle","text":"The \u201cWalk Cycle\u201d is the first comprehensive procedural animation available in Duik Bassel.

This is a very useful tool if you are compositing traditional animation or trying to achieve a traditional look on CG animations. It can change the framerate of the composition or of the properties at any time, mixing framerates (what\u2019s called the \u201cexposure\u201d in traditional animation) in the same composition, for different layers or at different times. Setup You can use the X-Sheet either as an adjustment layer for the whole comp, or on properties. To use it as an adjustment layer, just click on the \u201cX-Sheet\u201d button. To add it on properties, select the properties before clicking in the button. Effect There are four ways to adjust the exposure of the animations / the compostion. By Frame Duration: This way, you just have to set the exposure with the \u201cFrame Duration\u201d value. For example, setting this value to 2 in a 24fps comp will run the animation at 12fps, setting in to 3 in the same comp will run it at 8fps. This value can be animated to change the exposure at any time. The three other methods do not use an exposure / framerate value, but keyframes or markers to set the times when the frame must change. This allows a very precise control on the exposure, and works like a X-Sheet in traditionnal animation. The \u201cX-sheet\u201d method uses keyframes on the \u201cX-Sheet\u201d value of the effect: it will change the frame at each keyframe on the checkbox, no matter the value of the checkbox itself (it does not matter to check or uncheck it, it is only the time of the keyframe which is used). The last two methods works the same way but using composition or layer markers instead of keyframes. The displayed frame will be changed at each marker time.

A Zero is a standard null object, which has exactly the same transform values as the layer it works with, and it is inserted in the hierarchy, between the layer and its former parent.
