## install.py

Edit the file to set the After Effects version, then run the script to sy√±link the Duik Angela panel in After Effects. This is the preferred way to develop Duik from any IDE and test the actual panel.

You'll need `pyuac` to run the script:

```sh
pip install pyuac
pip install pypiwin32
```
